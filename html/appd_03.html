<h2 class="sect1">D.3. Typical Uses</h2>

<p>A typical use of the <a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6457" />Template Toolkit is as an offline tool
for generating static web pages from source templates. This alone can
be invaluable as a way of consistently adding standard headers,
footers, menus, or other presentation elements to all of the pages in
a web site.</p>

<p>The <em class="emphasis">ttree</em> utility, distributed
<a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6458" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6459" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6460" />as part of the toolkit, can be
used to automatically process an entire directory tree of files in
this way. Rather than creating and maintaining web pages directly,
you write your pages as source templates and use
<em class="emphasis">ttree</em> to run them through the Template Toolkit
and publish them to a new location, ready to be viewed or accessed by
your web server. During this process, any directives embedded within
the templates are interpreted accordingly to build up the final HTML
content. This can be then be combined automatically with any other
standard page elements or layout templates before the output is
written to the destination file.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6461" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6462" />Template Toolkit in CGI scripts and
mod_perl handlers for generating dynamic web content. The
<tt class="literal">Template</tt> module <a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6463" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6464" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6465" />provides a simple programming-level
interface to the template processing engine and allows you to cleanly
separate your application code from presentation logic and layout. It
provides a rich set of bindings between Perl data and code in the
backend and template variables in the frontend. That means you can
call into templates from your Perl code and also call into Perl code
from your templates. You can freely pass all kinds of Perl data
between the front- and backends, in the form of scalars, hashes,
lists, subroutines, and object references, allowing you to hide all
manner of internal complexity behind a simple data interface. This
makes it easy for you to perform all sorts of technical wizardry in
your templates, without having to directly expose or embed any of the
Perl code that makes it happen.</p>

<p>The Template Toolkit includes a number of
<a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6466" /><a name="pmodperl-APP-D-ITERM-6467" />standard plug-in modules that provide
various useful add-on functionalities. These include modules for
creating HTML tables; fetching CGI parameters; parsing and processing
XML, POD, and LaTeX; accessing databases via <tt class="literal">DBI</tt>;
manipulating dates; processing URLs; and generating graphics, to name
just a few. It's also trivially easy to load and use
other existing Perl modules. If CPAN doesn't have
what you're looking for, you can always implement
your own custom functionality as a Perl module, which can then be
loaded into the Template Toolkit for use and reuse as required.</p>

<p>This approach makes your code and your templates much easier to
develop and maintain. If the people working on Perl application code
are different from those who develop the HTML pages, it allows them
to work on their separate areas without getting in each
other's way. Even if you're the one
doing all the work, it allows you to better separate the tasks and
wear just one hat at a time. When you're wearing
your application developer's hat, you can
concentrate on the Perl code and making it work right. When
you're wearing your web page
designer's hat, you can concentrate on the HTML
markup and making it look good.</p>

<p>It also makes your backend code and your frontend templates more
reusable. You can have the same backend code running behind multiple
sets of frontend templates, ideal for creating different versions of
the same web site localized to spoken languages or customized to
different users' requirements. You can also reuse
the same set of templates in front of different backend applications,
CGI scripts, and mod_perl handlers. Common elements such as headers,
footers, and menus can be encoded as templates and then shared
between your static pages generated via <em class="emphasis">ttree</em>
and your dynamic pages generated online. The result is that you get a
consistent user interface and presentation style for all your pages,
regardless of how they're generated.</p>
