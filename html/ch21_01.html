easy task with plain Perl: just invoke the program with the
<em class="emphasis">-d</em> flag to invoke the debugger. Under mod_perl,
however, you have to jump through a few hoops.</p><p>In this chapter we explain how to correctly handle server, program,
and user errors and how to keep your user loyal to your service by
displaying good error messages.</p><p>We also demonstrate how you can peek at what is going on in a

the value of a global variable, seeing what database connections are
open, tracing what modules were loaded and their paths, checking the
value of <tt class="literal">@INC</tt>, and much more.</p><p>It's been said that there's always
one more bug in any given program. Bugs that show symptoms during the
development cycle are usually easily found. As their number
diminishes, the bugs become harder to find. Subtle interactions
between software components can create bugs that
aren't easily reproduced. In such cases, tools and
techniques that can help track down the offending code come in handy.</p><div class="sect1"><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">21.1. Warnings and Errors Explained</h2>

<p>The Perl interpreter
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5449" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5450" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5451" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5452" />distinguishes
between warnings and errors. <em class="emphasis">Warnings</em> are
messages that the Perl interpreter prints to
<tt class="literal">STDERR</tt> (or to Apache's error log
under mod_perl). These messages indicate that Perl thinks there is a
problem with your code, but they do not prevent the code from
running. <em class="emphasis">Errors</em> are output in the same way as
warnings, but the program terminates after an error. For example,
errors occur if your code uses invalid syntax. If a <tt class="literal">die(
)</tt> occurs outside of any exception-handling
<tt class="literal">eval</tt>, it behaves just like an error, with a
message being output and program execution terminating.</p>

<p>For someone new to Perl programming, the warning and error messages
output by Perl can be confusing and worrysome. In this section we
will show you how to interpret Perl's messages, and
how to track down and solve the problems that cause them.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.1.1. The Importance of Warnings</h3>

<p>Just like
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5453" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5454" />errors, Perl's optional
warnings, if they are enabled, go to the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file. You have enabled them in your
development server, haven't you? We discussed the
various techniques to enable warnings in <a href="ch04_01.html">Chapter 4</a> and <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6</a>, but we will
repeat them in this section.</p>

<p>The code you write lives a dual life. In the first life it is
written, tested, debugged, improved, tested, debugged, rewritten,
retested, and debugged again. In the second life
it's just <em class="emphasis">used</em>.</p>

<p>A significant part of the script's first life is
spent on the developer's machine. The second life is
spent on the production server, where the code is supposed to be
perfect.</p>

<p>When you develop the code you want all the help you can get to spot
possible problems. By enabling warnings you will ensure that Perl
gives you all the help it can to identify actual or potential
problems in your code. Whenever you see an error or warning in the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em>, you <em class="emphasis">must</em> try to
get rid of it.</p>

<p>But why bother, if the program runs and seems to work?</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The Perl interpreter issues warnings because it thinks that
something's wrong with your code. The Perl
interpreter is rarely wrong; if you ignore the warnings it provides,
you may well encounter problems later, perhaps when the code is used
on the production server.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If each invocation of a script generates any superfluous warnings, it
will be very hard to catch real problems. The warnings that seem
important will be lost amongst the mass of
"unimportant" warnings that you
didn't bother to fix. All warnings are important,
and all warnings can be dealt with.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>On the other hand, on a production server, you really want to
turn<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5455" /> warnings off. And there are good
reasons for this:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>There is no added value in having the same warning showing up, again
and again, triggered by thousands of script invocations. If your code
isn't very clean and generates even a single warning
per script invocation, on the heavily loaded server you will end up
with a huge <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file in a short time.</p>

<p>The warning-elimination phase is supposed to be a part of the
development process and should be done before the code goes live.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In any Perl script, not just under mod_perl, enabling runtime
warnings has a performance impact.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>mod_perl provides a very simple solution to handling warnings, so you
should avoid enabling warnings in the scripts themselves unless you
really have to. Let mod_perl control this mode globally. All you need
to do is put the directive:</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5456" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5457" /><blockquote><pre class="code">PerlWarn On</pre></blockquote>

<p>in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> on your development machine and
the directive:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlWarn Off</pre></blockquote>

<p>on the live machine.</p>

<p>If there is a piece of code that generates warnings and you want to
disable them only in that code, you can do that too. The Perl special
variable <tt class="literal">$^W</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5458" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5459" />
allows you to
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5460" />dynamically turn warnings mode on
and off.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">{
    local $^W = 0;
    # some code that generates innocuous warnings
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Don't forget to localize the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5461" />setting
inside a block. By localizing the variable you switch warnings off
only within the scope of the block and ensure that the original value
of <tt class="literal">$^W</tt> is restored upon exit from the block.
Without localization, the setting of <tt class="literal">$^W</tt> will
affect <em class="emphasis">all</em> the requests handled by the Apache
child process that changed this variable, for
<em class="emphasis">all</em> the scripts it executes&#8212;not just the
one that changed <tt class="literal">$^W</tt>!</p>

<p>Starting from Perl 5.6.0 you can use the
<tt class="literal">warnings</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5462" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5463" />
pragma:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">{
    no warnings;
    # some code that generates innocuous warnings
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">diagnostics</tt> pragma can shed more light on
errors and warnings, as we will see in the following sections.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-1.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">21.1.1.1. The diagnostics pragma</h3>

<p>This<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5464" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5465" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5466" /> pragma extends the terse diagnostics
normally emitted during the compilation and runtime phases and
augments them with the more verbose and endearing descriptions found
in the <em class="emphasis">perldiag</em> manpage.</p>

<p>Like any other pragma, <tt class="literal">diagnostics</tt> is invoked with
<tt class="literal">use</tt>, by placing:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use diagnostics;</pre></blockquote>

<p>in your program. This also turns warnings mode on for the scope of
the program.</p>

<p>This pragma is especially useful when you are new to Perl and want a
better explanation of the errors and warnings. It's
also helpful when you encounter some warning you've
never seen before&#8212;e.g., when a new warning has been introduced
in an upgraded version of Perl.</p>

<p>You may not want to leave diagnostics mode on for your production
server. For each warning, diagnostics mode generates about ten times
more output than warnings mode. If your code generates warnings that
go into the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file, with the diagnostics
pragma you will use disk space much faster.</p>

<p>Diagnostics mode adds a large performance
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5467" />overhead in
comparison with just having the warnings mode on. You can see the
benchmark results in <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">21.1.2. Curing "Internal Server Error" Problems</h3>

<p>Say you've<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5468" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5469" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5470" /> just installed a new
script, and when you try it out you see the grey screen of death
saying "Internal Server Error"
(<a href="ch21_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-21-FIG-1">Figure 21-1</a>). Or even worse,
you've had a script running on a production server
for a long time without problems, when the same grey screen starts to
show up occasionally for no apparent reason.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-FIG-1" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/pmp_2101.gif" alt="Figure 21-1" width="481" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 21-1. Internal Server Error</h4>

<p>How can you find out what the problem is, before you actually attempt
to solve it?</p>

<p>The first problem is determining the location of the error message.</p>

<p>You have been coding in Perl for years, and whenever an error
occurred in the past it was displayed in the same terminal window
from which you started the script. But when you work with a web
server, the errors do not show up in a terminal. In many cases, the
server has no terminal to which to send the error messages.</p>

<p>Actually, the error messages don't disappear; they
end up in <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5471" />the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5472" /> file.
Its location is specified by the
<tt class="literal">ErrorLog</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5473" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5474" />
directive in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>. The default setting is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ErrorLog logs/error_log</pre></blockquote>

<p>where <em class="emphasis">logs/error_log</em> is appended to the value of
the <tt class="literal">ServerRoot</tt> directive.</p>

<p>If you've followed the convention
we've used in this book and your
<tt class="literal">ServerRoot</tt> is:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ServerRoot /home/httpd/httpd_perl</pre></blockquote>

<p>the full path to the file will be
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</em>.</p>

<p>Whenever you see "Internal Server
Error" in a browser it's time to
look at this file.</p>

<p>There are cases when errors don't go to the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file. This can happen when the server
is starting and hasn't gotten as far as opening the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file for writing before it needs to
write an error message. In that case, Apache writes the messages to
<tt class="literal">STDERR</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5475" />. If you have entered a
nonexistent directory path in your <tt class="literal">ErrorLog</tt>
directive in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>, the error message will
be printed to <tt class="literal">STDERR</tt>. If the error happens when
the server executes a <tt class="literal">PerlRequire</tt>,
<tt class="literal">PerlModule</tt>, or other startup-time directive you
might also see output sent to <tt class="literal">STDERR</tt>. If you
haven't redirected Apache's
<tt class="literal">STDERR</tt>, then the messages are printed to the
console (tty, terminal) from which you started the server.</p>

<p>Note that when you're running the server in
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5476" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5477" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5478" />single-process mode (<em class="emphasis">httpd
-X</em>), the usual startup message:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Apache/1.3.24 (Unix) mod_perl/1.26 configured</pre></blockquote>

<p>won't appear in the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>
file. Also, any startup warnings will be printed to the console,
since in this mode the server redirects its STDERR stream to the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file only at a later stage.</p>

<p>The first problem is solved: we know where the error messages are.</p>

<p>The second problem is,
how<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5479" /> useful is
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5480" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5481" />the error message?</p>

<p>The usefulness of the error message depends to some extent on the
programmer's coding style. An uninformative message
might not help you spot and fix the error.</p>

<p>For example, let's take a function that opens a file
passed to it as a parameter for reading. It does nothing else with
the file. Here's the first version of the code:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $r = shift;
$r-&gt;send_http_header('text/plain');

sub open_file {
    my $filename = shift;
    die "No filename passed" unless defined $filename;
    open FILE, $filename or die;
}

open_file("/tmp/test.txt");</pre></blockquote>

<p>Let's assume that <em class="emphasis">/tmp/test.txt</em>
doesn't exist, so the <tt class="literal">open( )</tt>
call will fail to open the file. When we call this script from our
browser, the browser returns an "Internal Server
Error" message and we see the following error
appended to <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Died at /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>We can use the hint Perl kindly gave to us to find where in the code
<tt class="literal">die( )</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5482" /> was called. However, we still
won't necessarily know what filename was passed to
this subroutine to cause the program termination.</p>

<p>If we have only one function call, as in the example above, the task
of finding the problematic filename is trivial. Now
let's add one more <tt class="literal">open_file( )</tt>
function call and assume that of the two, only the file
<em class="emphasis">/tmp/test.txt</em> exists:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">open_file("/tmp/test.txt");
open_file("/tmp/test2.txt");</pre></blockquote>

<p>When you execute the above call, you will see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Died at /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Based on this error message, can you tell what file your program
failed to open? Probably not. Let's improve it by
showing the name of the file that failed:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sub open_file {
    my $filename = shift;
    die "No filename passed" unless defined $filename;
    open FILE, $filename or die "failed to open $filename";
}

open_file("/tmp/test2.txt");</pre></blockquote>

<p>When we execute the above code, we see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">failed to open /tmp/test2.txt at
    /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>which obviously makes a big difference, since now we know what file
we failed to open.</p>

<p>By the way, if you append a newline to the end of the message you
pass to <tt class="literal">die( )</tt>, Perl won't report
the line number at which the error has happened. If you write:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">open FILE, $filename or die "failed to open $filename\n";</pre></blockquote>

<p>the error message will be:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">failed to open /tmp/test2.txt</pre></blockquote>

<p>which gives you very little to go on. It's very hard
to debug with such uninformative error messages.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">warn( )</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5483" /> function outputs an error message in the
same way as <tt class="literal">die( )</tt>, but whereas <tt class="literal">die(
)</tt> causes program termination, execution continues normally
after a <tt class="literal">warn( )</tt>. Just like with <tt class="literal">die(
)</tt>, if you add a newline to the end of the message, the
filename and the line number from which <tt class="literal">warn( )</tt>
was called won't be logged.</p>

<p>You might want to use <tt class="literal">warn( )</tt> instead of
<tt class="literal">die( )</tt> if the failure isn't
critical. Consider the following code:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">if (open FILE, $filename) {
    # do something with the file
    close FILE;
}
else {
    warn "failed to open $filename";
}
# more code here...</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, unless you have a really good reason to do otherwise, you
should generally <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> when your code encounters
any problem whatsoever. It can be very hard to catch a problem that
manifests itself only several hundred lines after the problem was
caused.</p>

<p>A different approach for producing useful warnings and error messages
is to print the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5484" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5485" />function call stack
backtrace. The <tt class="literal">Carp</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5486" />
module comes to our aid with its <tt class="literal">cluck(
)</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5487" /> function. Consider the script in <a href="ch21_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-1">Example 21-1</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 21-1. warnings.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use Carp ( );
local $SIG{_ _WARN_ _} = \&amp;Carp::cluck;

correct( );
incorrect( );

sub correct   { print_value("Perl"); }
sub incorrect { print_value( ); }

sub print_value {
  my $var = shift;
  print "My value is $var\n";
}</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p><tt class="literal">Carp::cluck( )</tt> is assigned as a warnings signal
handler. Whenever a warning is triggered, this function will be
called. When we execute the script, we see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">My value is Perl
Use of uninitialized value at ./warnings.pl line 15.
  main::print_value( ) called at ./warnings.pl line 11
  main::incorrect( ) called at ./warnings.pl line 8
My value is</pre></blockquote>

<p>Take a moment to understand the stack trace in the warning. The
deepest calls are printed first. So the second line tells us that the
warning was triggered in <tt class="literal">print_value( )</tt> and the
third line tells us that <tt class="literal">print_value( )</tt> was called
by the subroutine <tt class="literal">incorrect( )</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">script -&gt; incorrect( ) -&gt; print_value( )</pre></blockquote>

<p>When we look at the source code for the function <tt class="literal">incorrect(
)</tt>, we see that we forgot to pass the variable to the
<tt class="literal">print_value( )</tt> function. Of course, when you write
a subroutine like <tt class="literal">print_value( )</tt>,
it's a good idea to check the passed arguments
before starting execution. We omitted that step to contrive an easily
debuggable example.</p>

<p>You can also call <tt class="literal">Carp::cluck( )</tt> directly in your
code, and it will produce the call-stack backtrace for you. This is
usually very useful during the code development phase.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Carp::confess( )</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5488" /> is like <tt class="literal">Carp::cluck(
)</tt>, but it acts as a <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> function
(i.e., terminates the program) and prints the call-stack backtrace.
The functions <tt class="literal">Carp::carp(
)</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5489" />
and <tt class="literal">Carp::croak( )</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5490" /> are two other equivalents of
<tt class="literal">warn( )</tt> and <tt class="literal">die( )</tt>,
respectivily, but they report about the caller of the function in
which they are used, rather the function itself.</p>

<p>In some cases the built-in <tt class="literal">caller(
)</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5491" /> function can be useful as well, but it
can be a bit cumbersome to use when you need to peek several levels
up the call stack.</p>

<p>When using the <tt class="literal">warn( )</tt> and <tt class="literal">die(
)</tt> functions, be aware of the following pitfall. Here the
message passed to <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> is printed with no
problems, assuming the file <em class="emphasis">/does_not_exist</em>
actually doesn't exist:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -e 'open F, "/does_not_exist" or die "cannot open the file"'</pre></blockquote>

<p>But now try the same code using the equivalent <tt class="literal">||</tt>
operator:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -e 'open F, "/does_not_exist" || die "cannot open the file"'</pre></blockquote>

<p>Nothing happens! The pitfall lies in the precedence of the
<tt class="literal">||</tt> operator. The above call is equal to:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -e 'open F, ("/does_not_exist" || die "cannot open the file")'</pre></blockquote>

<p>where the left part returns true, and makes this call equivalent to:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -e 'open F, "/does_not_exist"'</pre></blockquote>

<p>So the <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> part has effectively disappeared.
Make sure you always use the low-precendence logical OR operator
<tt class="literal">or</tt> in this situation. Alternatively, you can use
parentheses, but this is less visually appealing:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -e 'open(F, "/does_not_exist") || die("cannot open the file")'</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only the first pair of parentheses is really needed here, but to be
consistent we use them through the whole statement.</p>

<p>Now let's return to improving the warning and error
messages. The failing code reports the names of the problematic
files, but we still don't know the real reason for
the failure. Let's try to improve the <tt class="literal">warn(
)</tt> example. The <tt class="literal">-r</tt> operator tests whether
the file is readable:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">if (-r $filename) {
    open FILE, $filename;
    # do something with file
}
else {
    warn "Couldn't open $filename - doesn't exist or is not readable";
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now if we cannot read the file we do not even try to open it. But we
still see a warning in <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Couldn't open /tmp/test.txt - doesn't exist or is not readable
at /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>The warning tells us the reason for the failure, so we
don't have to go to the code and check what it was
trying to do with the file.</p>

<p>It could be quite a coding overhead to explain all the possible
failure reasons that way, but why reinvent the wheel? We already have
the reason for the failure stored in the <tt class="literal">$!</tt>
variable. Let's go back to the <tt class="literal">open_file(
)</tt> function:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sub open_file {
    my $filename = shift;
    die "No filename passed" unless defined $filename;
    open FILE, $filename or die "failed to open $filename: $!";
}

open_file("/tmp/test.txt");</pre></blockquote>

<p>This time, if <tt class="literal">open( )</tt> fails we see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">failed to open /tmp/test.txt: No such file or directory
at /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now we have all the information we need to debug these problems: we
know what line of code triggered <tt class="literal">die( )</tt>, we know
what file we were trying to open, and we also know the reason,
provided by Perl's <tt class="literal">$!</tt> variable.</p>

<p>Note that there's a big difference between the
following two commonly seen bits of Perl code:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">open FILE, $filename or die "Can't open $filename: $!";
open FILE, $filename or die "Can't open $filename!";</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first bit is helpful; the second is just rude. Please do your
part to ease human suffering, and use the first version, not the
second.</p>

<p>To show our useful error messages in action, let's
cause an error. We'll create the file
<em class="emphasis">/tmp/test.txt</em> as a different user and make sure
that it isn't readable by Apache processes:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% touch /tmp/test.txt
panic% chmod 0600 /tmp/test.txt # -rw-------</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now when we execute the latest version of the code, we see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">failed to open /tmp/test.txt: Permission denied
at /home/httpd/perl/test.pl line 9.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here we see a different reason: we created a file that
doesn't belong to the user the server runs as
(usually <em class="emphasis">nobody</em>). It does not have permission to
read the file.</p>

<p>Now you can see that it's much easier to debug your
code if you validate the return values of the system calls and
properly code arguments to <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> and
<tt class="literal">warn( )</tt> calls. The <tt class="literal">open( )</tt>
function is just one of the many system calls Perl provides.</p>

<p>Second problem solved: we now have useful error messages.</p>

<p>So now you can code and see error messages from mod_perl scripts and
modules as easily as if they were plain Perl scripts that you
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5492" />execute<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5493" /> from <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5494" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5495" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5496" />a shell.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">21.1.3. Making Use of the error_log</h3>

<p>It's a good <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5497" />idea to
keep the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> open all the time in a
dedicated terminal using <tt class="literal">tail -f</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% tail -f /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</pre></blockquote>

<p>or <tt class="literal">less -S</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% less -S /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can use whichever one you prefer (the latter allows you to
navigate around the file, search, etc.). This will ensure that you
see all the errors and warnings as they happen.</p>

<p>Another tip is to create a shell <em class="emphasis">alias</em>, to make
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5498" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5499" />it easier to execute the
above commands. In a C-style shell, use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% alias err "tail -f /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log"</pre></blockquote>

<p>In a Bourne-style shell, use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% alias err='tail -f /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log'</pre></blockquote>

<p>From now on, in the shell you set the alias in, executing:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% err</pre></blockquote>

<p>will execute <em class="emphasis">tail -f
/home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</em>. If you are using a
C-style shell, put the alias into your <em class="emphasis">~/.cshrc</em>
file or its equivalent. For setting this alias globally to all users,
put it into <em class="emphasis">/etc/csh.cshrc</em> or similar. If you
are using a Bourne-style shell, the corresponding files are usually
<em class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</em> and <em class="emphasis">/etc/profile</em>.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-1.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.1.4. Displaying Errors to Users</h3>

<p>If you<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5500" /> spend a lot of time browsing the
Internet, you will see many error messages, ranging from generic but
useless messages like "An error has
happened" to the cryptic ones that no one
understands. If you are developing a user-friendly system,
it's important to understand that the errors are
divided into at least two major groups:
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5501" /><em class="emphasis">user
related</em> and <em class="emphasis">server related</em>. When an
error happens, you want to notify either a user or a server
administrator, according to the category of the error. In some cases
you may want to notify both.</p>

<p>If you set a file-upload limit to 1 MB and a user tries to upload a
file bigger than the limit, it is a user error. You should report
this error to the user, explain why the error has happened, and tell
the user what to do to resolve the problem. Since we are talking
about the Web, the error should be sent to the
user's browser. A system administrator usually
doesn't care about this kind of error, and therefore
probably shouldn't be notified, but it may be an
indication of an attempt to compromise the server, so that may be a
reason to notify the administrator.</p>

<p>If the user has successfully uploaded a file, but the server has
failed to save this file for some reason (e.g., it ran out of free
disk space), the error should be logged in
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> if possible and the system
administrator should be notified by email, pager, or similar means.
Since the user couldn't accomplish what she was
trying to do, you must tell her that the operation failed. The user
probably doesn't care why the operation has failed,
but she would want to know how to resolve it (e.g., in the worst
case, tell her to try again later). The actual reason for the error
probably shouldn't be displayed&#8212;if you do, it
will probably only confuse the user. Instead, you should nicely
explain that something went wrong and that the system administrator
has been notified and will take care of the problem as soon as
possible. If the service is very mission-critical, you probably need
to provide the user with some problem tracking number and a way to
contact a human, so she will be able to figure out when the problem
has been resolved. Alternatively, you may want to ask for the
user's email address and use this to follow up on
the problem.</p>

<p>Some applications use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);</pre></blockquote>

<p>which sends <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5502" />all the errors to the browser. This
module might be useful in development, if you have a problem
accessing your server using an interactive session, so you can see
the contents of the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file. But please
don't leave this line in the production version of
your code. Instead, trap the errors and decide what to do about each
error separately. To trap
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5503" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5504" />errors, you can use the <tt class="literal">eval(
)</tt> exception-handling mechanism:<a href="#FOOTNOTE-49">[49]</a></p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-49" /><p> [49]Notice the
semicolon after the <tt class="literal">eval { }</tt> block.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">eval {
    # do something
};
if ($@) {
    # decide what to do about the error stored in $@
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>which is equivalent to the C++/Java/other languages concept of:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">try {
    # do something
}
catch {
    # do something about errors
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>There are also <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5505" />CPAN modules, such as
<tt class="literal">Error</tt> and <tt class="literal">Exception::Class</tt>,
that use the same approach but provide a special interface for doing
exception handling (and also provide additional functionality).</p>

<p>Another technique is to assign a <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5506" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5507" />signal handler:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$SIG{_ _DIE_ _} = sub {
    print STDERR "error: ", join("\n", @_), "\n";
    exit;
};</pre></blockquote>

<p>When <tt class="literal">die( )</tt> is called, this anonymous function
will be invoked and the argument list to <tt class="literal">die( )</tt>
will be forwarded to it. So if later in the code you write:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">die "good bye, cruel world";</pre></blockquote>

<p>the code will print to <tt class="literal">STDERR</tt> (which under
mod_perl usually ends up in <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">error: good bye, cruel world</pre></blockquote>

<p>and the normal program flow will be aborted, since the handler has
called <tt class="literal">exit( )</tt>.</p>

<p>If you don't localize this setting as:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">local $SIG{_ _DIE_ _} = sub {...};</pre></blockquote>

<p>it affects the whole process. It also interferes with
Perl's normal exception mechanism, shown earlier; in
fact, it breaks Perl's exception handling, because a
signal handler will be called before you get the chance to examine
<tt class="literal">$@</tt> after calling the <tt class="literal">eval</tt>
block.</p>

<p>You can attempt to work around this problem by checking the value of
<tt class="literal">$^S</tt>, which is true when the code is running in the
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> block. If you are using
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> or a similar module, the code is
always executed within an <tt class="literal">eval</tt> block, so this is
not a good solution.</p>

<p>Since the signal handler setting is global, it's
possible that some other module might try to assign its own signal
handler for <tt class="literal">_ _DIE_ _</tt>, and therefore there will be
a mess. The two signal handlers will conflict with each other,
leading to unexpected behavior. You should avoid using this
technique, and use Perl's standard
<tt class="literal">eval</tt> exception-handling mechanism instead. For
more information about exception handling, see<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5508" /> <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html#Exception_Handling_for_mod_perl">http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html#Exception_Handling_for_mod_perl</a>.</p>
