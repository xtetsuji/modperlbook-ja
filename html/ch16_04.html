<h2 class="sect1">16.4. HTTP Requests</h2>

<p>Section 13.11 of the specification states that the only two cacheable
methods are <tt class="literal">GET</tt> and <tt class="literal">HEAD</tt>.
Responses to <tt class="literal">POST</tt> requests are not cacheable, as
you'll see in a moment.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-SECT-4.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.1. GET Requests</h3>

<p>Most mod_perl programs are written to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5290" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5291" />service <tt class="literal">GET</tt>
requests. The server passes the request to the mod_perl code, which
composes and sends back the headers and the content body.</p>

<p>But there is a certain situation that needs a workaround to achieve
better cacheability. We need to deal with the "<tt class="literal">?</tt>"
in the relative path part of the requested URI. Section 13.9
specifies that:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">... caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless the server provides 
an explicit expiration time.  This specifically means that responses from HTTP/1.0 
servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT be taken from a cache.</pre></blockquote>

<p>Although it is tempting to imagine that if we are using HTTP/1.1 and
send an explicit expiration time we are safe, the reality is
unfortunately somewhat different. It has been common for quite a long
time to misconfigure cache servers so that they treat all
<tt class="literal">GET</tt> requests containing a question mark as
uncacheable. People even used to mark anything that contained the
string "cgi-bin" as uncacheable.</p>

<p>To work around this bug in <tt class="literal">HEAD</tt> requests, we have
stopped calling CGI directories <em class="emphasis">cgi-bin</em> and we
have written the following handler, which lets us work with CGI-like
query strings without rewriting the software (e.g.,
<tt class="literal">Apache::Request</tt> and <tt class="literal">CGI.pm</tt>)
that deals with them:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sub handler {
    my $r = shift;
    my $uri = $r-&gt;uri;
    if ( my($u1,$u2) = $uri =~ / ^ ([^?]+?) ; ([^?]*) $ /x ) {
        $r-&gt;uri($u1);
        $r-&gt;args($u2);
    }
    elsif ( my ($u1,$u2) = $uri =~ m/^(.*?)%3[Bb](.*)$/ ) {
        # protect against old proxies that escape volens nolens
        # (see HTTP standard section 5.1.2)
        $r-&gt;uri($u1);
        $u2 =~ s/%3[Bb]/;/g;
        $u2 =~ s/%26/;/g; # &amp;
        $u2 =~ s/%3[Dd]/=/g;
        $r-&gt;args($u2);
    }
    DECLINED;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This handler must be installed as a
<tt class="literal">PerlPostReadRequestHandler</tt>.</p>

<p>The handler takes any request that contains one or more semicolons
but <em class="emphasis">no</em> question mark and changes it so that the
first semicolon is interpreted as a question mark and everything
after that as the query string. So now we can replace the request:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">http://example.com/query?BGCOLOR=blue;FGCOLOR=red</pre></blockquote>

<p>with:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">http://example.com/query;BGCOLOR=blue;FGCOLOR=red</pre></blockquote>

<p>This allows the coexistence of queries from ordinary forms that are
being processed by a browser alongside predefined requests for the
same resource. It has one minor bug: Apache doesn't
allow percent-escaped slashes in such a query string. So instead of:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">http://example.com/query;BGCOLOR=blue;FGCOLOR=red;FONT=%2Ffont%2Fpath</pre></blockquote>

<p>we must use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">http://example.com/query;BGCOLOR=blue;FGCOLOR=red;FONT=/font/path</pre></blockquote>

<p>To unescape the escaped characters, use the following code:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">s/%([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr hex $1/ge;</pre></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-SECT-4.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.2. Conditional GET Requests</h3>

<p>A rather challenging request that may be <a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5292" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5293" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5294" />received is the conditional
<tt class="literal">GET</tt>, which typically means a request with an
<tt class="literal">If-Modified-Since</tt> header. The HTTP specification
has this to say:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">The semantics of the GET method change to a "conditional GET" if the request message 
includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-
Range header field.  A conditional GET method requests that the entity be transferred 
only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The 
conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing
cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or transferring 
data already held by the client.</pre></blockquote>

<p>So how can we reduce the unnecessary network usage in such a case?
mod_perl makes it easy by providing access to
Apache's <tt class="literal">meets_conditions( )</tt>
function (which lives in <tt class="literal">Apache::File</tt>). The
<tt class="literal">Last-Modified</tt> (and possibly
<tt class="literal">ETag</tt>) headers must be set up before calling this
method. If the return value of this method is anything other than
<tt class="literal">OK</tt>, then this value is the one that should be
returned from the handler when we have finished. Apache handles the
rest for us. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">if ((my $result = $r-&gt;meets_conditions) != OK) {
    return $result;
}
#else ... go and send the response body ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>If we have a Squid accelerator running, it will often handle the
conditionals for us, and we can enjoy its extremely fast responses
for such requests by reading the <em class="emphasis">access.log</em>
file. Just <em class="emphasis">grep</em> for
<tt class="literal">TCP_IMS_HIT/304</tt>. However, there are circumstances
under which Squid may not be allowed to use its cache. That is why
the origin server (which is the server we are programming) needs to
handle conditional <tt class="literal">GET</tt>s as well, even if a Squid
accelerator is running.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-SECT-4.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.3. HEAD Requests</h3>

<p>Among the headers described thus far, <a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5295" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5296" />the date-related ones
(<tt class="literal">Date</tt>, <tt class="literal">Last-Modified</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">Expires</tt>/<tt class="literal">Cache-Control</tt>) are
usually easy to produce and thus should be computed for
<tt class="literal">HEAD</tt> requests just the same as for
<tt class="literal">GET</tt> requests.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Content-Type</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Content-Length</tt> headers should be exactly the same
as would be supplied to the corresponding <tt class="literal">GET</tt>
request. But since it may be expensive to compute them, they can
easily be omitted, since there is nothing in the specification that
requires them to be sent.</p>

<p>What is important is that the response to a <tt class="literal">HEAD</tt>
request <em class="emphasis">must not</em> contain a message-body. The
code in a mod_perl handler might look like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code"># compute the headers that are easy to compute
# currently equivalent to $r-&gt;method eq "HEAD"
if ( $r-&gt;header_only ) { 
    $r-&gt;send_http_header;
    return OK;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>If a Squid accelerator is being used, it will be able to handle the
whole <tt class="literal">HEAD</tt> request by itself, but under some
circumstances it may not be allowed to do so.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-SECT-4.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">16.4.4. POST Requests</h3>

<p>The response to a <tt class="literal">POST</tt> request is
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5297" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5298" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-16-ITERM-5299" />not cacheable, due to an
underspecification in the HTTP standards. Section 13.4 does not
forbid caching of responses to <tt class="literal">POST</tt> requests, but
no other part of the HTTP standard explains how the caching of
<tt class="literal">POST</tt> requests could be implemented, so we are in a
vacuum. No existing caching servers implement the caching of
<tt class="literal">POST</tt> requests (although some browsers with more
aggressive caching implement their own caching of POST requests).
However, this may change if someone does the groundwork of defining
the semantics for cache operations on <tt class="literal">POST</tt>
requests.</p>

<p>Note that if a Squid accelerator is being used, you should be aware
that it accelerates outgoing traffic but does not bundle incoming
traffic. Squid is of no benefit at all on <tt class="literal">POST</tt>
requests, which could be a problem if the site receives a lot of long
<tt class="literal">POST</tt> requests. Using <tt class="literal">GET</tt>
instead of <tt class="literal">POST</tt> means that requests can be cached,
so the possibility of using <tt class="literal">GET</tt>s should always be
considered. However, unlike with <tt class="literal">POST</tt>s, there are
size limits and visibility issues that apply to
<tt class="literal">GET</tt>s, so they may not be suitable in every case.</p>
