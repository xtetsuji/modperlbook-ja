<h2 class="sect1">12.13. Running More than One mod_perl Server on the Same Machine</h2>

<p>Let's assume <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5057" />that you have two
different sets of code that have little or nothing in
common&#8212;different Perl modules, no code sharing. Typical numbers
can be 4 MB of unshared<a href="#FOOTNOTE-45">[45]</a> and 4
MB of shared memory for each code set, plus 3 MB of shared basic
mod_perl stuff&#8212;which makes each process 17 MB in size when the
two code sets are loaded. Let's also assume that we
have 251 MB of RAM dedicated to the web server
(<tt class="literal">Total_RAM</tt>):</p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-45" /><p> [45]4 MB of unshared memory is a
pretty typical size, especially when connecting to databases, as the
database connections cannot be shared. Databases like Oracle can take
even more RAM per connection on top of this.</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Shared_RAM_per_Child :  11MB
Max_Process_Size     :  17MB
Total_RAM            : 251MB</pre></blockquote>

<p>According to the equation developed in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11</a>:</p>
<img src="figs/ch12eq13.gif" alt="Figure " /><img src="figs/ch12eq14.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>We see that we can run 40 processes, using the given memory and the
two code sets in the same server.</p>

<p>Now consider this practical decision. Since we have recognized that
the code sets are very distinct in nature and there is no significant
memory sharing in place, the wise thing to do is to split the two
code sets between two mod_perl servers (a single mod_perl server
actually is a set of the parent process and a number of the child
processes). So instead of running everything on one server, now we
move the second code set onto another mod_perl server. At this point
we are talking about a single machine.</p>

<p>Let's look at the figures again. After the split we
will have 20 11-MB processes (4 MB unshared + 7 MB shared) running on
one server and another 20 such processes running on the other server.</p>

<p>How much memory do we need now? From the above equation we derive:</p>
<img src="figs/ch12eq15.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>Using our numbers, this works out to a total of 174 MB of memory
required:</p>
<img src="figs/ch12eq16.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>But hey, we have 251 MB of memory! That leaves us with 77 MB of free
memory. If we recalculate <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>, we will see
that we can run almost 60 more servers:</p>
<img src="figs/ch12eq17.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>So we can run about 19 more servers using the same memory
size&#8212;that's almost 30 servers for each code
set instead of 20. We have enlarged the server pool by half without
changing the machine's hardware.</p>

<p>Moreover, this new setup allows us to fine-tune the two code
sets&#8212;in reality the smaller code base might have a higher hit
rate&#8212;so we can benefit even more.</p>

<p>Let's assume that, based on usage statistics, we
know that the first code set is called in 70% of requests and the
other is called in the remaining 30%. Now we assume that the first
code set requires only 5 MB of RAM (3 MB shared + 2 MB unshared) over
the basic mod_perl server size, and the second set needs 11 MB (7 MB
shared + 4 MB unshared).</p>

<p>Let's compare this new requirement with our original
50:50 setup (here we have assigned the same number of clients for
each code set).</p>

<p>So now the first mod_perl server running the first code set will have
all its processes using 8 MB (3 MB server shared + 3 MB code shared +
2 MB code unshared), and the second server's process
will each be using 14 MB of RAM (3 MB server shared + 7MB code shared
+ 4 MB code unshared). Given that we have a 70:30 hit relation and
that we have 251 MB of available memory, we have to solve this set of
equations:</p>
<img src="figs/ch12eq18.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>where <em class="emphasis">X</em> is the total number of processes the
first code set can use and <em class="emphasis">Y</em> the second. The
first equation reflects the 70:30 hit relation, and the second uses
the equation for the total memory requirements for the given number
of servers and the shared and unshared memory sizes.</p>

<p>When we solve these equations, we find that <em class="emphasis">X</em> =
63 and <em class="emphasis">Y</em> = 27. So we have a total of 90
servers&#8212;two and a half times more than in the original setup
using the same memory size.</p>

<p>The hit-rate optimized solution and the fact that the code sets can
be different in their memory requirements allowed us to run 30 more
servers in total and gave us 33 more servers (63 versus 30) for the
most-wanted code base, relative to the simple 50:50 split used in the
first example.</p>

<p>Of course, if you identify more than two distinct sets of code based
on your hit rate statistics, more complicated solutions may be
required. You could even make more splits and run three or more
mod_perl servers.</p>

<p>However, you shouldn't get carried away. Remember
that having too many running processes doesn't
necessarily mean better performance, because all of them will contend
for CPU time slices. The more processes that are running, the less
CPU time each gets and the slower overall performance will be.
Therefore, after hitting a certain load you might want to start
spreading your servers over different machines.</p>

<p>When you have different components running on different servers, in
addition to the obvious memory saving, you gain the power to more
easily troubleshoot problems that occur. It's quite
possible that a small change in the server configuration to fix or
improve something for one code set might completely break the second
code set. For example, if you upgrade the first code set and it
requires an update of some modules that both code bases rely on,
there is a chance that the second code set won't
work with the new versions of those<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5058" /> modules.</p>
