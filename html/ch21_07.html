<h2 class="sect1">21.7. Hanging Processes: Detection and Diagnostics</h2>

<p>Sometimes an <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> process might hang in the
middle of processing a request. This may happen because of a bug in
the code, such as being stuck in a <tt class="literal">while</tt> loop. Or
it may be blocked in a system call, perhaps waiting indefinitely for
an unavailable resource. To fix the problem, we need to learn in what
circumstances the process hangs, so that we can reproduce the
problem, which will allow us to uncover its cause.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-7.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.7.1. Hanging Because of an Operating System Problem</h3>

<p>Sometimes <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5666" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5667" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5668" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5669" />you can find a process hanging
because of some kind of system problem. For example, if the processes
was doing some disk I/O operation, it might get stuck in
uninterruptible sleep ('<tt class="literal">D</tt>' disk wait in
<em class="emphasis">ps</em> report, '<tt class="literal">U</tt>' in
<em class="emphasis">top</em>), which indicates either that something is
broken in your kernel or that you're using NFS.
Also, usually you find that you cannot <em class="emphasis">kill -9</em>
this process.</p>

<p>Another process that cannot be killed with <em class="emphasis">kill
-9</em> is a zombie process ('<tt class="literal">Z</tt>' disk wait
in <em class="emphasis">ps</em> report, <tt class="literal">&lt;defunc&gt;</tt>
in <em class="emphasis">top</em>), in which case the process is already
dead and Apache didn't wait on it properly (of
course, it can be some other process not related to Apache).</p>

<p>In the case of <em class="emphasis">disk wait</em>, you can actually get
the <em class="emphasis">wait</em> channel from <em class="emphasis">ps</em>
and look it up in your kernel symbol table to find out what resource
it was waiting on. This might point the way to what component of the
system is misbehaving, if the problem occurs frequently.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-7.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.7.2. When a Process Might Hang</h3>

<p>In <a href="ch19_01.html">Chapter 19</a>, we<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5670" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5671" /> discussed the concept of deadlock. This
can happen when two processes are each trying to acquire locks on the
resources held by the other. Neither process will release the lock it
currently holds, and thus neither can acquire a lock on the second
resource it desires.</p>

<p>This scenario is a very good candidate for code that might lead to a
hanging process. Since usually the deadlock cannot be resolved
without manual intervention, the two processes will hang, doing
nothing and wasting system resources, while trying to acquire locks.</p>

<p>An infinite loop might lead to a hanging process as well. Moreover,
such a loop will usually consume a lot of CPU resources and memory.
You should be very careful when using <tt class="literal">while</tt> and
similar loop constructs that are capable of creating endless loops.</p>

<p>A process relying on some external resource, for example when
accessing a file over NFS, might hang if the mounted partition it
tries to access is not available. Usually it takes a long time before
the request times out, and in the meantime the process may hang.</p>

<p>There are many other reasons that a process might hang, but these are
some of the most common.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-7.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.7.3. Detecting Hanging Processes</h3>

<p>It's not so easy to<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5672" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5673" />
detect hanging processes. There is no way you can tell how long the
request is taking to process by using plain system utilities such as
<em class="emphasis">ps</em> and <em class="emphasis">top</em>. The reason is
that each Apache process serves many requests without quitting.
System utilities can tell how long the process has been running since
its creation, but this information is useless in our case, since
Apache processes normally run for extended periods.</p>

<p>However, there are a few approaches that can help to detect a hanging
process. If the hanging process happens to demand lots of resources,
it's quite easy to spot it by using the
<em class="emphasis">top</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5674" /> utility. You will see the same
process show up in the first few lines of the automatically refreshed
report. (But often the hanging process uses few resources&#8212;e.g.,
when waiting for some event to happen.)</p>

<p>Another easy case is when some process thrashes the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5675" /> file, writing millions of error
messages there. Generally this process uses lots of resources and is
also easily spotted by using <em class="emphasis">top</em>.</p>

<p>Two other tools that report the status of Apache processes are the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5676" />mod_status
module, which is usually accessed from the
<em class="emphasis">/server_status</em> location, and the
<tt class="literal">Apache::VMonitor</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5677" /> module, covered in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>Both tools provide counters of requests processed per Apache process.
You can watch the report for a few minutes and try to spot any
process with an unchanging number of processed requests and a status
of <em class="emphasis">W</em> (waiting). This means that it has hung.</p>

<p>But if you have 50 processes, it can be quite hard to spot such a
process.
<tt class="literal">Apache::Watchdog::RunAway</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5678" /> is a hanging-processes monitor and
terminator that implements this feature and could be used to solve
this kind of problem. It's covered in <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a really bad problem, where processes hang one after the
other, the time will come when the number of hanging processes is
equal to the value of <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>. This means that
no more processes will be spawned. As far as the users are concerned,
your server will be down. It is easy to detect this situation,
attempt to resolve it, and notify the administrator using a simple
<em class="emphasis">crontab</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5679" />
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5680" />watchdog that periodically requests
some very light script (see <a href="ch05_01.html">Chapter 5</a>).</p>

<p>In the watchdog, you set a timeout appropriate for your service,
which may be anything from a few seconds to a few minutes. If the
server fails to respond before the timeout expires, the watchdog
spots trouble and attempts to restart the server. After a restart an
email report is sent to the administrator saying that there was a
problem and whether or not the restart was successful.</p>

<p>If you get such reports constantly, something is wrong with your web
service and you should review your code. Note that
it's possible that your server is being overloaded
by more requests than it can handle, so the requests are being queued
and not processed for a while, which triggers the
watchdog's alarm. If this is the case, you may need
to add more servers or more memory, or perhaps split a single machine
across a cluster of machines.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-7.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">21.7.4. Determination of the Reason</h3>

<p>Given the PID, there are three ways to find out where the server is
hanging:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Deploy the Perl calls-tracing mechanism. This will allow you to spot
the location of the Perl code that triggers the problem.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use a system calls-tracing utility such as
<em class="emphasis">strace</em>. This approach reveals low-level details
about the misbehavior of some part of the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use an interactive debugger such as <tt class="literal">gdb</tt>. When the
process is stuck and you don't know what it was
doing just before it got stuck, using <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> you can
attach to this process and print its call stack, to reveal where the
last call originated. Just like with <em class="emphasis">strace</em>, you
see the C function call trace, not the Perl high-level function
calls.</p>
</li></ul>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-SECT-7.4.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">21.7.4.1. Using the Perl trace</h3>

<p>To see <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5681" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5682" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5683" />where an
<em class="emphasis">httpd</em> process is spinning, the first step is to
add the following to your startup file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">package Book::StartUp;
use Carp ( );
$SIG{'USR2'} = sub { 
    Carp::confess("caught SIGUSR2!");
};</pre></blockquote>

<p>The above code assigns a signal handler for the
<tt class="literal">USR2</tt>signal. This signal has been chosen because
it's unlikely to be used by the other server
components.</p>

<p>We can check the registered signal handlers with help of
<tt class="literal">Apache::Status</tt>. Using this code, if we fetch the
URL <em class="emphasis">http://localhost/perl-status?sig</em> we will
see:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">USR2 = \&amp;Book::StartUp::_ _ANON_ _</pre></blockquote>

<p>where <tt class="literal">Book::StartUp</tt> is the name of the package
declared in <em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em>.</p>

<p>After applying this server configuration, let's use
the simple code in <a href="ch21_07.html#pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-10">Example 21-10</a>, where
<tt class="literal">sleep(10000)</tt> will emulate a hanging process.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-10" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 21-10. debug/perl_trace.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">local $|=1;
my $r = shift;
$r-&gt;send_http_header('text/plain');

print "[$$] Going to sleep\n";
hanging_sub( );

sub hanging_sub { sleep 10000; }</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>We execute the above script as
<em class="emphasis">http://localhost/perl/debug/perl_trace.pl</em>. In
the script we use <tt class="literal">$|=1;</tt> to unbuffer the STDOUT
stream and we get the PID from the <tt class="literal">$$</tt>special
variable.</p>

<p>Now we issue the <em class="emphasis">kill</em> command, using the PID we
have just seen printed to the browser's window:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% kill -USR2 PID</pre></blockquote>

<p>and watch this showing up in the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">caught SIGUSR2!
    at /home/httpd/perl/startup/startup.pl line 32
Book::StartUp::_ _ANON_ _('USR2') called

<p>We can clearly see that the process
"hangs" in the code executed at
line 6 of the
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/perl/debug/perl_trace.pl</em> script, and
it was called by the <tt class="literal">hanging_sub( )</tt> routine

</div>

<p>The reason this simple code hangs is obvious. It never breaks from
the <tt class="literal">while</tt> loop. As you can see, it prints the PID
of the current process to the browser. Of course, in a real situation
you cannot use the same trick&#8212;in the previous section we
presented several ways to detect the runaway processes and their
PIDs.</p>

<p>We save the above code in a file and make a request. As usual, we use
<tt class="literal">$|=1;</tt> in our demonstration scripts to unbuffer
STDOUT so we will immediately see the process ID. Once the script is
requested, the script prints the PID and obviously hangs. So we press
the Stop button, but the process continues to hang in this code.
Isn't Apache supposed to detect the broken
connection and abort the request? Yes and no&#8212;you will
understand soon what's really happening.</p>

<p>First let's attach to the process and see what
it's doing. We use the PID the script printed to the
browser&#8212;in this case, it is 10045:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% strace -p 10045

[...truncated identical output...]
SYS_175(0, 0xbffff41c, 0xbffff39c, 0x8, 0) = 0
SYS_174(0x11, 0, 0xbffff1a0, 0x8, 0x11) = 0
SYS_175(0x2, 0xbffff39c, 0, 0x8, 0x2)   = 0
nanosleep(0xbffff308, 0xbffff308, 0x401a61b4, 0xbffff308, 0xbffff41c) = 0
time([940973834])                       = 940973834
time([940973834])                       = 940973834
[...truncated the identical output...]</pre></blockquote>

<p>It isn't what we expected to see, is it? These are
some system calls we don't see in our little
example. What we actually see is how Perl translates our code into
system calls. We know that our code hangs in this snippet:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">while (1) {
    $i++;
    sleep 1;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>so these must be the system calls that represent this loop, since
they are printed repeatedly.</p>

<p>Usually the situation is different from the one we have shown. You
first detect the hanging process, then you attach to it and watch the
trace of calls it does (or observe the last few system calls if the
process is hanging waiting for something, as when blocking on a
file-lock request). From watching the trace you figure out what
it's actually doing, and probably find the
corresponding lines in your Perl code. For example,
let's see how one process hangs while requesting an
exclusive lock on a file that is exclusively locked by another
process (see <a href="ch21_07.html#pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-12">Example 21-12</a>).</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-EX-12" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 21-12. excl_lock.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
use Symbol;

fork( ); # child and parent do the same operation

my $fh = gensym;
open $fh, "&gt;/tmp/lock" or die "cannot open /tmp/lock: $!";
print "$$: I'm going to obtain the lock\n";
flock $fh, LOCK_EX;
print "$$: I've got the lock\n";
sleep 30;
close $fh;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The code is simple. The process executing the code forks a second
process, and both do the same thing: generate a unique symbol to be
used as a file handle, open the lock file for writing using the
generated symbol, lock the file in exclusive mode, sleep for 30
seconds (pretending to do some lengthy operation), and close the lock
file, which also unlocks the file.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">gensym</tt> function is imported from the
<tt class="literal">Symbol</tt> module. The <tt class="literal">Fcntl</tt> module
provides us with a symbolic constant, <tt class="literal">LOCK_EX</tt>.
This is imported via the <tt class="literal">:flock</tt> tag, which imports
this and other <tt class="literal">flock( )</tt> constants.</p>

<p>The code used by both processes is identical, so we cannot predict
which one will get its hands on the lock file and succeed in locking
it first. Thus, we add <tt class="literal">print( )</tt>statements to find
the PID of the process blocking (waiting to get the lock) on a lock
request.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed from the command line, we see that
one of the processes gets the lock:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl ./excl_lock.pl

3038: I'm going to obtain the lock
3038: I've got the lock
3037: I'm going to obtain the lock</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here we see that process 3037 is blocking, so we attach to it:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% strace -p 3037

about to attach c10
flock(3, LOCK_EX</pre></blockquote>

<p>It's clear from the above trace that the process is
waiting for an exclusive lock. The missing closing parenthesis is not
a typo; it means that <em class="emphasis">strace</em>
didn't yet receive a return status from the call.</p>

<p>After spending time watching the running traces of different scripts,
you will learn to more easily recognize what Perl code is being
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5690" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5691" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5692" />executed.</p>

<p>Another <a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5693" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5694" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5695" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5696" />way to see a trace of the running
code is to use a debugger such as <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> (the GNU
debugger). It's supposed to work on any platform
that supports the GNU development tools. Its purpose is to allow you
to see what is going on inside a program while it executes, or what
it was doing at the moment it failed.</p>

<p>To trace the execution of a process, <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> needs to
know the PID and the path to the binary that the process is
executing. For Perl code, it's
<em class="emphasis">/usr/bin/perl</em> (or whatever the path to your Perl
is). For <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> processes, it's
the path to your <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> executable&#8212;often
the binary is called <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>, but
there's really no standard location for it.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples using <tt class="literal">gdb</tt>. First,
let's go back to our last locking example, execute
it as before, and attach to the process that didn't
get the lock:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% gdb /usr/bin/perl 3037</pre></blockquote>

<p>After starting the debugger, we execute the
<em class="emphasis">where</em> command to see the trace:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) where
#0  0x40209791 in flock ( ) from /lib/libc.so.6
#1  0x400e8dc9 in Perl_pp_flock ( ) at pp_sys.c:2033
#2  0x40099c56 in Perl_runops_debug ( ) at run.c:53

    at perlmain.c:52
#6  0x4018bcbe in _ _libc_start_main ( ) from /lib/libc.so.6</pre></blockquote>

<p>That's not what we may have expected to see (i.e., a
Perl stack trace). And now it's a different trace
from the one we saw when we were using <em class="emphasis">strace</em>.
Here we see the current state of the call stack, with <tt class="literal">main(
)</tt> at the bottom of the stack and <tt class="literal">flock(
)</tt> at the top.</p>

<p>We have to find out the place the code was called
from&#8212;it's possible that the code calls
<tt class="literal">flock( )</tt> in several places, and we
won't be able to locate the place in the code where
the actual problem occurs without having this information. Therefore,
we again use the <em class="emphasis">curinfo</em> macro after loading it
from the <em class="emphasis">.gdbinit</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) source /usr/src/httpd_perl/mod_perl-1.25/.gdbinit
(gdb) curinfo
9:/home/httpd/perl/excl_lock.pl</pre></blockquote>

<p>As we can see, the program was stuck at line 9 of
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/perl/excl_lock.pl</em> and
that's the place to look at to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>When you attach to a running process with <tt class="literal">gdb</tt>, the
program stops executing and control of the program is passed to the
debugger. You can continue the normal program run with the
<em class="emphasis">continue</em> command or execute it step by step with
the <em class="emphasis">next</em> and <em class="emphasis">step</em> commands,
which you type at the <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> prompt.
(<em class="emphasis">next</em> steps over any function calls in the
source, while <em class="emphasis">step</em> steps into them.)</p>

<p>The use of C/C++ debuggers is a large topic, beyond the scope of this
book. The <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> man and info pages are quite good.
You might also want to check <tt class="literal">ddd</tt> (the Data Display
Debugger), which provides a visual interface to
<tt class="literal">gdb</tt> and other debuggers. It even knows how to
debug Perl programs.</p>

<p>For completeness, let's see the
<tt class="literal">gdb</tt> trace of the <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>
process that's hanging in the
<tt class="literal">while(1)</tt> loop of the first example in this

<p>As before, we can see a complete trace of the last executed call. To
see the line the program hangs, we use <em class="emphasis">curinfo</em>
again:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) source /usr/src/httpd_perl/mod_perl-1.25/.gdbinit
(gdb) curinfo
9:/home/httpd/perl/hangme.pl</pre></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, the program spends most of its time at line 9:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">7 : while (1) {
8 :     $i++;
9 :    sleep 1;
10: }</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since <tt class="literal">while( )</tt> and <tt class="literal">$i++</tt> are
executed very fast, it's almost impossible to catch
Perl running either of these<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5697" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5698" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5699" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5700" /> instructions.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">21.7.5. mod_perl gdb Debug Macros</h3>

<p>So far we have<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5701" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5702" /> seen only the use of the
<em class="emphasis">curinfo</em> <tt class="literal">gdb</tt> macro.
Let's explore a few more <tt class="literal">gdb</tt>
macros that come with the mod_perl source and might be handy during a
problem debug.</p>

<p>Remember that we are still stuck in the <tt class="literal">while(1)</tt>
loop, and that's when we are going to run the macros
(assuming of course that they were loaded as per our last example).
The <em class="emphasis">longmess</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5703" /> macro shows us the full Perl
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5704" />backtrace of the current state:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) longmess
at /home/httpd/perl/hangme.pl line 9
Apache::ROOT::perl::hangme_2epl::handler
('Apache=SCALAR(0x82ec0ec)') called at 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i386-linux/Apache/Registry.pm 
line 143
eval {...} called at 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i386-linux/Apache/Registry.pm 
line 143
Apache::Registry::handler('Apache=SCALAR(0x82ec0ec)') 
called at (eval 29) line 0
eval {...} called at (eval 29) line 0</pre></blockquote>

<p>So we can see that we are inside the
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> handler, which was executed via
<tt class="literal">eval( )</tt>, and the program is currently executing
the code on line 9 in the script
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/perl/hangme.pl</em>. Internally the macro
uses <tt class="literal">Carp::longmess( )</tt> to generate the trace. The
<em class="emphasis">shortmess</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5705" /> macro is similar to
<em class="emphasis">longmess</em>, but it prints only the top-level
caller's package, via <tt class="literal">Carp::shortmess(
)</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) shortmess 
at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i386-linux/Apache/Registry.pm
line 143</pre></blockquote>

<p>Don't search for <tt class="literal">shortmess( )</tt> or
<tt class="literal">longmess( )</tt> functions in the
<tt class="literal">Carp</tt> manpage&#8212;you won't find
them, as they aren't a part of the public API. The
<em class="emphasis">caller</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-21-ITERM-5706" /> macro prints the package that called the
last command:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">(gdb) caller
caller = Apache::ROOT::perl::hangme_2epl</pre></blockquote>

<p>In our example this is the
<tt class="literal">Apache::ROOT::perl::hangme_2epl</tt> package, which was
created on the fly by <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>.</p>

<p>Other macros allow you to look at the values of variables and will
probably require some level of Perl API knowledge. You may want to
refer to the <em class="emphasis">perlxs</em>,
<em class="emphasis">perlguts</em> and other related manpages before you
proceed with these.</p>
