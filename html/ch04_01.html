<h2 class="sect1">4.1. Apache Configuration</h2>

<p>Apache configuration can be confusing. To minimize the number of
things that can go wrong, it's a good idea to first
configure Apache itself without mod_perl. So before we go into
mod_perl configuration, let's look at the basics of
Apache itself.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.1. Configuration Files</h3>

<p>Prior to<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3804" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3805" /> Version
1.3.4, the default Apache installation used three configuration
files: <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>,
<em class="emphasis">srm.conf</em>, and <em class="emphasis">access.conf</em>.
Although there were historical reasons for having three separate
files (dating back to the NCSA server), it stopped mattering which
file you used for what a long time ago, and the Apache team finally
decided to combine them. Apache Versions 1.3.4 and later are
distributed with the configuration directives in a single file,
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3806" />.
Therefore, whenever we mention a configuration file, we are referring
to <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>.</p>

<p>By default, <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> is
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3807" />installed in the
<em class="emphasis">conf</em> directory under the server root directory.
The default server root is <em class="emphasis">/usr/local/apache/</em> on
many Unix platforms, but it can be any directory of your choice
(within reason). Users new to Apache and mod_perl will probably find
it helpful to keep to the directory layouts we use in this book.</p>

<p>There is also a special file called
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3808" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3809" />, used for per-directory
configuration. When Apache tries to access a file on the filesystem,
it will first search for <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files in the
requested file's parent directories. If found,
Apache scans <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> for further configuration
directives, which it then applies only to that directory in which the
file was found and its subdirectories. The name
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> is confusing, because it can contain
almost any configuration directives, not just those related to
resource access control. Note that if the following directive is in
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /&gt;
    AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Apache will not look for <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> at all unless
<tt class="literal">AllowOverride</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3810" /> is set to a value other than
<tt class="literal">None</tt> in a more specific
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>section.</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> can be renamed by using the
<tt class="literal">AccessFileName</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3811" /> directive. The following example
configures Apache to look in the target directory for a file called
<em class="emphasis">.acl</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">AccessFileName .acl</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, you must also make sure that this file
can't be accessed directly from the Web, or else you
risk exposing your configuration. This is done automatically for
<em class="emphasis">.ht*</em> files by Apache, but for other files you
need to use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Files .acl&gt;
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Another often-mentioned file is the startup file, usually named
<em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3812" />. This file contains Perl code that will be
executed at server startup. We'll discuss the
<em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file in greater detail later in this
chapter, in <a href="ch04_03.html#pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-3">Section 4.3</a>.</p>

<p>Beware of editing <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>
without<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3813" /> understanding all the implications.
Modifying the configuration file and adding new directives can
introduce security problems and have performance implications. If you
are going to modify anything, read through the documentation
beforehand. The Apache distribution comes with an extensive
configuration manual. In addition, each section of the distributed
configuration file includes helpful comments explaining how each
directive should be configured and what the default values are.</p>

<p>If you haven't moved Apache's
directories around, the installation program will configure
everything for you. You can just start the server and test it. To
start the server, use the <em class="emphasis">apachectl</em> utility
bundled with the Apache distribution. It resides in the same
directory as <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>, the Apache
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3814" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3815" />server itself. Execute:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now you can test the server, for example by accessing
<em class="emphasis">http://localhost/</em> from a browser running on the
same host.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.2. Configuration Directives</h3>

<p>A basic setup
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3816" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3817" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3818" />requires little configuration.
If you moved any directories after Apache was installed, they should
be updated in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>. Here are just a couple
of examples:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ServerRoot   "/usr/local/apache"
DocumentRoot "/usr/local/apache/docs"</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can change the port to which the server is bound by editing the
<tt class="literal">Port</tt> directive. This example sets the port to 8080
(the default for the HTTP protocol is 80):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Port 8080</pre></blockquote>

<p>You might want to change the user and group names under which the
server will run. If Apache is started by the user
<em class="emphasis">root</em> (which is generally the case), the parent
process will continue to run as <em class="emphasis">root</em>, but its
children will run as the user and group specified in the
configuration, thereby avoiding many potential security problems.
This example uses the <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> user and group:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">User httpd
Group httpd</pre></blockquote>

<p>Make sure that the user and group <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> already
exist. They can be created using <em class="emphasis">useradd(1)</em> and
<em class="emphasis">groupadd(1)</em> or equivalent utilities.</p>

<p>Many other directives may need to be configured as well. In addition
to directives that take a single value, there are whole sections of
the configuration (such as the <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>
and <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>sections) that apply to only
certain areas of the web space. The <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>
file supplies a few examples, and these will be discussed shortly.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.3. &lt;Directory&gt;, &lt;Location&gt;, and &lt;Files&gt; Sections</h3>

<p>Let's discuss the basics of the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>,
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>sections. Remember that there is
more to know about them than what we list here, and the rest of the
information is available in the Apache documentation. The information
we'll present here is just what is important for
understanding mod_perl configuration.</p>

<p>Apache considers directories and files on the machine it runs on as
<em class="emphasis">resources</em>. A particular behavior can be
specified for each resource; that behavior will apply to every
request for information from that particular resource.</p>

<p>Directives in <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3819" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3820" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3821" /><tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>
sections apply to specific directories on the host machine, and those
in <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3822" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3823" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3824" /><tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>
sections apply only to specific files (actually, groups of files with
names that have something in common).
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3825" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3826" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3827" /> sections
apply to specific URIs. Locations are given relative to the document
root, whereas directories are given as absolute paths starting from
the filesystem root (<em class="emphasis">/</em>). For example, in the
default server directory layout where the server root is
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/apache</em> and the document root is
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/apache/htdocs</em>, files under the
<em class="emphasis">/usr/local/apache/htdocs/pub</em> directory can be
referred to as:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/pub&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>or alternatively (and preferably) as:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Location /pub&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Exercise caution when using <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt> under
Win32. The Windows family of operating systems are case-insensitive.
In the above example, configuration directives specified for the
location <em class="emphasis">/pub</em> on a case-sensitive Unix machine
will not be applied when the request URI is
<em class="emphasis">/Pub</em>. When URIs map to existing files, such as
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>scripts, it is safer to use the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> or
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt> directives, which correctly
canonicalize filenames according to local filesystem semantics.</p>

<p>It is up to you to decide which directories on your host machine are
mapped to which locations. This should be done with care, because the
security of the server may be at stake. In particular, essential
system directories such as <em class="emphasis">/etc/</em>
shouldn't be mapped to locations accessible through
the web server. As a general rule, it might be best to organize
everything accessed from the Web under your
<em class="emphasis">ServerRoot</em>, so that it stays organized and you
can keep track of which directories are actually accessible.</p>

<p>Locations do not necessarily have to refer to existing physical
directories, but may refer to virtual resources that the server
creates upon a browser request. As you will see, this is often the
case for a mod_perl server.</p>

<p>When a client (browser)
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3828" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3829" />requests a resource (URI plus optional
arguments) from the server, Apache determines from its configuration
whether or not to serve the request, whether to pass the request on
to another server, what (if any) authentication and authorization is
required for access to the resource, and which module(s) should be
invoked to generate the response.</p>

<p>For any given resource, the various sections in the configuration may
provide conflicting information. Consider, for example, a
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>section that specifies that
authorization is required for access to the resource, and a
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>section that says that it is not. It
is not always obvious which directive takes precedence in such cases.
This can be a trap for the unwary.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.3.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">4.1.3.1. &lt;Directory directoryPath&gt; ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</h3>

<p><em class="emphasis">Scope</em>: Can appear in server and virtual host
configurations.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3830" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3831" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3832" /> and
<tt class="literal">&lt;/Directory&gt;</tt> are used to enclose a group
of<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3833" />
directives that will apply to only the named directory and its
contents, including any subdirectories. Any directive that is allowed
in a directory context (see the Apache documentation) may be used.</p>

<p>The path given in the <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> directive
is either the full path to a directory, or a string containing
wildcard characters (also called <em class="emphasis">globs</em>). In the
latter case, <tt class="literal">?</tt> matches any single character,
<tt class="literal">*</tt> matches any sequence of characters, and
<tt class="literal">[ ]</tt> matches character ranges. These are similar to
the wildcards used by <em class="emphasis">sh</em> and similar shells. For
example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs/foo[1-2]&gt;
    Options Indexes
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>will match <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/foo1</em> and
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/foo2</em>. None of the wildcards
will match a <tt class="literal">/</tt> character. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs&gt;
    Options Indexes
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>matches <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs</em> and applies to all its
subdirectories.</p>

<p>Matching a <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3834" />regular expression is done by using the
<tt class="literal">&lt;DirectoryMatch regex&gt; ..</tt>.
<tt class="literal">&lt;/DirectoryMatch&gt;</tt> or <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory
~ regex&gt; ... &lt;/Directory&gt;</tt>syntax. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;DirectoryMatch /home/www/.*/public&gt;
    Options Indexes
&lt;/DirectoryMatch&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>will match <em class="emphasis">/home/www/foo/public</em> but not
<em class="emphasis">/home/www/foo/private</em>. In a regular expression,
<tt class="literal">.*</tt> matches any character (represented by
.) zero or more times (represented by
<tt class="literal">*</tt>). This is entirely different from the
shell-style wildcards used by the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> directive. They make it easy to
apply a common configuration to a set of public directories. As
regular expressions are more flexible than globs, this method
provides more options to the experienced user.</p>

<p>If multiple (non-regular expression)
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections match the directory (or
its parents) containing a document, the directives are applied in the
order of the shortest match first, interspersed with the directives
from any <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files. Consider the following
configuration:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /&gt;
    AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs/&gt;
    AllowOverride FileInfo
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Let us detail the steps Apache goes through when it receives a
request for the file
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/index.html</em>:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Apply the directive <tt class="literal">AllowOverride None</tt> (disabling
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apply the directive <tt class="literal">AllowOverride FileInfo</tt> for the
directory <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/</em> (which now enables
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> in
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/</em> and its subdirectories).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apply any directives in the group <tt class="literal">FileInfo</tt>, which
control document types (<tt class="literal">AddEncoding</tt>,
<tt class="literal">AddLanguage</tt>, <tt class="literal">AddType</tt>,
etc.&#8212;see the Apache documentation for more information) found
in <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/.htaccess</em>.</p>
</li></ol>
</div>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.3.2" /><div class="sect3">

<p><em class="emphasis">Scope</em>: Can appear in server and virtual host
configurations, as well as in <em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3835" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3836" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3837" /> directive provides access control by
filename and is comparable to the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> and
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt> directives.
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>should be closed with the
corresponding <tt class="literal">&lt;/Files&gt;</tt>. The directives
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3838" />specified
within this section will be applied to any object with a basename
matching the specified filename. (A basename is the last component of
a path, generally the name of the file.)</p>

<p><tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>sections are processed in the order
in which they appear in the configuration file, after the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections and
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files are read, but before
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>sections. Note that
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt> can be nested inside
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections to restrict the portion
of the filesystem to which they apply. However,
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt> cannot be nested inside
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>sections.</p>

<p>The filename argument should include a filename or a wildcard string,
where <tt class="literal">?</tt> matches any single character and
<tt class="literal">*</tt> matches any sequence of characters, just as with
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections. Extended regular
expressions can also be used, placing a tilde character
(<tt class="literal">~</tt>) between the directive and the regular
expression. The regular expression should be in quotes. The dollar
symbol (<tt class="literal">$</tt>) refers to the end of the string. The
pipe character (<tt class="literal">|</tt>) indicates alternatives, and
parentheses (<tt class="literal">()</tt>) can be used for grouping. Special
characters in extended regular expressions must be escaped with
backslashes (<tt class="literal">\</tt>). For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Files ~ "\.(pl|cgi)$"&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options +ExecCGI
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>would match all the files ending with the <em class="emphasis">.pl</em> or
<em class="emphasis">.cgi</em> extension (most likely Perl scripts).
Alternatively, the <tt class="literal">&lt;FilesMatch regex&gt;</tt> ...
<tt class="literal">&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;</tt>syntax can be used.</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">Scope</em>: Can appear in server and virtual host

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3839" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3840" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3841" />directive
provides for directive scope limitation by URI. It is similar to the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> directive and starts a section
that is terminated with the <tt class="literal">&lt;/Location&gt;</tt>
directive.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>sections are processed in the
order in which they appear in the configuration file, after the
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections,
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> files, and
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>sections have been interpreted.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>section is the directive that
is used most often with mod_perl.</p>

<p>Note that URIs do not have to refer to real directories or files
within the filesystem at all; <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>
operates completely outside the filesystem. Indeed, it may sometimes
be wise to ensure that <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>s do not
match real paths, to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>The URI may use wildcards. In a wildcard string, <tt class="literal">?</tt>
matches any single character, <tt class="literal">*</tt> matches any
sequences of characters, and <tt class="literal">[ ]</tt> groups characters
to match. For regular expression matches, use the
<tt class="literal">&lt;LocationMatch regex&gt;</tt> ...
<tt class="literal">&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;</tt>syntax.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt> functionality is especially
useful when combined with the <tt class="literal">SetHandler</tt>
directive. For example, to enable server status requests (via
mod_status) but allow them only from browsers at
<em class="emphasis">*.example.com</em>, you might use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Location /status&gt;
    SetHandler server-status
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from .example.com
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the <em class="emphasis">/status</em> path does not exist
on the filesystem, but that doesn't matter because
the filesystem isn't consulted for this
request&#8212;it's passed on directly to mod_status.</p>

<p>Apart from <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>, each group is
processed in the order in which it appears in the configuration
files. <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>s (group 1 above) are
processed in order from the shortest directory component to the
longest (e.g., first <em class="emphasis">/</em> and only then
<em class="emphasis">/home/www</em>). If multiple
<tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>sections apply to the same
directory, they are processed in the configuration file order.</p>

<p>Sections inside <tt class="literal">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</tt>sections are
applied as if you were running several independent servers. The
directives inside one <tt class="literal">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</tt>section
do not interact with directives in other
<tt class="literal">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</tt>sections. They are applied
only after processing any sections outside the virtual host
definition. This allows virtual host configurations to override the
main server configuration.</p>

<p>If there is a conflict, sections found later in the configuration
file override those that come earlier.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.1.5. Subgrouping of &lt;Directory&gt;, &lt;Location&gt;, and &lt;Files&gt; Sections</h3>

<p>Let's <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3845" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3846" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3847" />say that you want all files to be
handled the same way, except for a few of the files in a specific
directory and its subdirectories. For example, say you want all the
files in <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs</em> to be processed as
plain files, but any files ending with <em class="emphasis">.html</em> and
<em class="emphasis">.txt</em> to be processed by the content handler of
the <tt class="literal">Apache::Compress</tt> module (assuming that you are
already running a mod_perl server):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs&gt;
    &lt;FilesMatch "\.(html|txt)$"&gt;
        PerlHandler +Apache::Compress
    &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">+</tt> before <tt class="literal">Apache::Compress</tt>
tells mod_perl to load the <tt class="literal">Apache::Compress</tt> module
before using it, as we will see later.</p>

<p>Using <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3848" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3849" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3850" /><tt class="literal">&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</tt>,
it is possible to embed sections inside other sections to create
subgroups that have their own distinct behavior. Alternatively, you
could also use a <tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt>section inside an
<em class="emphasis">.htaccess</em> file.</p>

<p>Note that you can't put
<tt class="literal">&lt;Files&gt;</tt> or
<tt class="literal">&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</tt>sections inside a
<tt class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</tt>section, but you can put them
inside a <tt class="literal">&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>section.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-SECT-1.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">4.1.6. Options Directive Merging</h3>

<p>Normally, if <a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3851" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3852" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3853" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3854" />multiple <tt class="literal">Options</tt>
directives apply to a directory, the most specific one is taken
completely; the options are not merged.</p>

<p>However, if all the options on the <tt class="literal">Options</tt>
directive are preceded by either a <tt class="literal">+</tt> or
<tt class="literal">-</tt>symbol, the options are merged. Any options
preceded by <tt class="literal">+</tt> are added to the options currently
active, and any options preceded by <tt class="literal">-</tt> are removed.</p>

<p>For example, without any <tt class="literal">+</tt> or <tt class="literal">-</tt>
symbols:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs/shtml&gt;
    Options Includes
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">Indexes</tt> and <tt class="literal">FollowSymLinks</tt> will
be set for <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/</em>, but only
<tt class="literal">Includes</tt> will be set for the
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/shtml/</em> directory. However, if
the second <tt class="literal">Options</tt> directive uses the
<tt class="literal">+</tt> and <tt class="literal">-</tt>symbols:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
&lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;Directory /home/httpd/docs/shtml&gt;
    Options +Includes -Indexes
&lt;/Directory&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>then the options <tt class="literal">FollowSymLinks</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Includes</tt> will be set for the
<em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/docs/shtml/</em> directory.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">4.1.7. MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, StartServers, MaxClients, and MaxRequestsPerChild</h3>

<p><tt class="literal">MinSpareServers</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3855" />,
<tt class="literal">MaxSpareServers</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3856" />,
<tt class="literal">StartServers</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3857" />, and
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3858" /> are
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3859" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3860" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-4-ITERM-3861" />standard Apache configuration
directives that control the number of servers being launched at
server startup and kept alive during the server's
operation. When Apache starts, it spawns
<tt class="literal">StartServers</tt> child processes. Apache makes sure
that at any given time there will be at least
<tt class="literal">MinSpareServers</tt> but no more than
<tt class="literal">MaxSpareServers</tt> idle servers. However, the
<tt class="literal">MinSpareServers</tt> rule is completely satisfied only
if the total number of live servers is no bigger than
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt> lets you specify the maximum
number of requests to be served by each child. When a process has
served <tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt> requests, the parent
kills it and replaces it with a new one. There may also be other
reasons why a child is killed, so each child will not necessarily
serve this many requests; however, each child will not be allowed to
serve more than this number of requests. This feature is handy to
gain more control of the server, and especially to avoid child
processes growing too big (RAM-wise) under mod_perl.</p>

<p>These five directives are very important for getting the best
performance out of your server. The process of tuning these variables
is described in great detail in <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11</a>.</p>
