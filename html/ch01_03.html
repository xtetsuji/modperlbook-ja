<h2 class="sect1">1.3. The Development of mod_perl 1.0</h2>

<p>Of the various <a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3359" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3360" />attempts to improve on
mod_cgi's shortcomings, mod_perl has proven to be
one of the better solutions and has been widely adopted by CGI
developers. Doug MacEachern fathered the core code of this Apache
module and licensed it under the Apache Software License, which is a
certified open source license.</p>

<p>mod_perl does away with mod_cgi's forking by
embedding the Perl interpreter into Apache's child
processes, thus avoiding the forking mod_cgi needed to run Perl
programs. In this new model, the child process
doesn't exit when it has processed a request. The
Perl interpreter is loaded only once, when the process is started.
Since the interpreter is persistent throughout the
process's lifetime, all code is loaded and compiled
only once, the first time it is needed. All subsequent requests run
much faster, because everything is already loaded and compiled.
Response processing is reduced to simply running the code, which
improves response times by a factor of 10-100, depending on the code
being executed.</p>

<p>But Doug's real accomplishment was adding a mod_perl
API to the Apache core. This made it possible to write complete
Apache modules in Perl, a feat that used to require coding in C. From
then on, mod_perl enabled the programmer to handle all phases of
request processing in Perl.</p>

<p>The mod_perl API also allows complete server configuration in Perl.
This has made the lives of many server administrators much easier, as
they now benefit from dynamically generating the configuration and
are freed from hunting for bugs in huge configuration files full of
similar directives for virtual hosts and the like.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-9">[9]</a></p>
<blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-9" /><p> [9]mod_vhost_alias offers similar functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To provide backward compatibility for plain CGI scripts that used to
be run under mod_cgi, while still benefiting from a preloaded Perl
interpreter and modules, a few special handlers were written, each
allowing a different level of proximity to pure mod_perl
functionality. Some take full advantage of mod_perl, while others do
not.</p>

<p>mod_perl embeds a copy of the Perl interpreter into the Apache
<em class="emphasis">httpd</em> executable, providing complete access to
Perl functionality within Apache. This enables a set of
mod_perl-specific configuration directives, all of which start with
the string <tt class="literal">Perl</tt>. Most, but not all, of these
directives are used to specify handlers for various phases of the
request.</p>

<p>It might occur
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3361" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3362" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3363" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3364" />to you that sticking a large executable
(Perl) into another large executable (Apache) creates a very, very
large program. mod_perl certainly makes <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>
significantly bigger, and you will need more RAM on your production
server to be able to run many mod_perl processes. However, in
reality, the situation is not as bad as it first appears. mod_perl
processes requests much faster, so the number of processes needed to
handle the same request rate is much lower relative to the mod_cgi
approach. Generally, you need slightly more available memory, but the
speed improvements you will see are well worth every megabyte of
memory you can add. Techniques that can reduce memory requirements
are covered in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://netcraft.com/">http://netcraft.com/</a>, as of January 2003,
mod_perl has been used on more than four million web sites. Some of
these sites have been using mod_perl since its early days. You can
see an extensive list of
sites<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3365" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3366" /> that
use mod_perl at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/outstanding/sites.html">http://perl.apache.org/outstanding/sites.html</a>

<h3 class="sect2">1.3.1. Running CGI Scripts with mod_perl</h3>

<p>Since many web application developers are interested in the content
delivery phase and come from a CGI background, mod_perl includes
packages designed to make the transition from CGI simple and
painless. <tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> run unmodified CGI scripts,
albeit much faster than mod_cgi.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-10">[10]</a></p>
<blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-10" /><p> [10]<tt class="literal">Apache::RegistryNG</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Apache::RegistryBB</tt> are two new experimental
modules that you may want to try as well.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The difference between
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3367" />
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3368" />and
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3369" /> is that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> caches all scripts, and
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> doesn't. To
understand why this matters, remember that if one of
mod_perl's benefits is added speed, another is
persistence. Just as the Perl interpreter is loaded only once, at
child process startup, your scripts are loaded and compiled only
once, when they are first used. This can be a double-edged sword:
persistence means global variables aren't reset to
initial values, and file and database handles aren't
closed when the script ends. This can wreak havoc in badly written
CGI scripts.</p>

<p>Whether you should use <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> or
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> for your CGI scripts depends on
how well written your existing Perl scripts are. Some scripts
initialize all variables, close all file handles, use taint mode, and
give only polite error messages. Others don't.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> compiles scripts on first use and
keeps the compiled scripts in memory. On subsequent requests, all the
needed code (the script and the modules it uses) is already compiled
and loaded in memory. This gives you enormous performance benefits,
but it requires that scripts be well behaved.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>, on the other hand, compiles
scripts at each request. The script's namespace is
flushed and is fresh at the start of every request. This allows
scripts to enjoy the basic benefit of mod_perl (i.e., not having to
load the Perl interpreter) without requiring poorly written scripts
to be rewritten.</p>

<p>A typical problem
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3370" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3371" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3372" />some developers encounter
when porting from mod_cgi to <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> is
the use of uninitialized global variables. Consider the following
script:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI;
$q = CGI-&gt;new( );
$topsecret = 1 if $q-&gt;param("secret") eq 'Muahaha';
# ...
if ($topsecret) {
    display_topsecret_data( );
}
else {
    security_alert( );
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This script will always do the right thing under mod_cgi: if
<tt class="literal">secret=Muahaha</tt> is supplied, the top-secret data
will be displayed via <tt class="literal">display_topsecret_data( )</tt>,
and if the authentication fails, the <tt class="literal">security_alert(
)</tt> function will be called. This works only because under
mod_cgi, all globals are undefined at the beginning of each request.</p>

<p>Under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>, however, global variables
preserve their values between requests. Now imagine a situation where
someone has successfully authenticated, setting the global variable
<tt class="literal">$topsecret</tt> to a true value. From now on, anyone
can access the top-secret data without knowing the secret phrase,
because <tt class="literal">$topsecret</tt> will stay true until the
process dies or is modified elsewhere in the code.</p>

<p>This is an example of sloppy code. It will do the right thing under
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>, since all global variables are
undefined before each iteration of the script. However, under
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> and mod_perl handlers, all global
variables must be initialized before they can be used.</p>

<p>The example can be fixed in a few ways. It's a good
idea to always use the <tt class="literal">strict</tt> mode, which requires
the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3373" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3374" />global
variables to be declared before they are used:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
use CGI;
use vars qw($top $q);
# init globals
$top = 0;
$q = undef;
# code
$q = CGI-&gt;new( );
$topsecret = 1 if $q-&gt;param("secret") eq 'Muahaha';
# ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>But of course, the simplest solution is to avoid using globals where
possible. Let's look at the example rewritten
without globals:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
use CGI;
my $q = CGI-&gt;new( );
my $topsecret = $q-&gt;param("secret") eq 'Muahaha' ? 1 : 0;
# ...</pre></blockquote>

<p>The last two versions of the example will run perfectly under
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>.</p>

<p>Here is another example that won't work correctly
under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>. This example presents a
simple search engine script:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI;
my $q = CGI-&gt;new( );
print $q-&gt;header('text/plain');
my @data = read_data( )
my $pat = $q-&gt;param("keyword");
foreach (@data) {
    print if /$pat/o;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>The example retrieves some data using <tt class="literal">read_data( )</tt>
(e.g., lines in the text file), tries to match the keyword submitted
by a user against this data, and prints the matching lines. The
<tt class="literal">/o</tt> regular expression modifier is used to compile
the regular expression only once, to speed up the matches. Without
it, the regular expression will be recompiled as many times as the
size of the <tt class="literal">@data</tt> array.</p>

<p>Now consider that <a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3375" />someone is using this script to search for
something inappropriate. Under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>,
the pattern will be cached and won't be recompiled
in subsequent requests, meaning that the next person using this
script (running in the same process) may receive something quite
unexpected as a result. Oops.</p>

<p>The proper solution to this problem is discussed in <a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6</a>, but <tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>
provides an immediate workaround, since it resets the regular
expression cache before each request.</p>

<p>So why bother to keep your code clean? Why not use
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> all the time? As we mentioned
earlier, the convenience provided by
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> comes at a price of performance
deterioration.</p>

<p>In <a href="ch09_01.html">Chapter 9</a>, we show in detail how to
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3376" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3377" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-ITERM-3378" />benchmark the code and server
configuration. Based on the results of the benchmark, you can tune
the service for the best performance. For now, let's
just show the benchmark of the short script in <a href="ch01_03.html#pmodperl-CHP-1-EX-6">Example 1-6</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-1-EX-6" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 1-6. readdir.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;

use CGI ( );
use IO::Dir ( );

my $q = CGI-&gt;new;
print $q-&gt;header("text/plain");
my $dir = IO::Dir-&gt;new(".");
print join "\n", $dir-&gt;read;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The script loads two modules (<tt class="literal">CGI</tt> and
<tt class="literal">IO::Dir</tt>), prints the HTTP header, and prints the
contents of the current directory. If we compare the performance of
this script under mod_cgi, <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>, we get the following results:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">  Mode          Requests/sec
-------------------------------
  Apache::Registry       473
  Apache::PerlRun        289
  mod_cgi                 10</pre></blockquote>

<p>Because the script does very little, the performance differences
between the three modes are very significant.
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> thoroughly outperforms mod_cgi,
and you can see that <tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> is much
faster than mod_cgi, although it is still about twice as slow as
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>. The performance gap usually
shrinks a bit as more code is added, as the overhead of
<tt class="literal">fork( )</tt> and code compilation becomes less
significant compared to execution times. But the benchmark results
won't change significantly.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead, if we convert the script in <a href="ch01_03.html#pmodperl-CHP-1-EX-6">Example 1-6</a> into a mod_perl handler, we can reach 517
requests per second under the same conditions, which is a bit faster
than <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>. In <a href="ch13_01.html">Chapter 13</a>, we discuss why running the code under the
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> handler is a bit slower than
using a pure mod_perl content handler.</p>

<p>It can easily be seen from this benchmark that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> is what you should use for your
scripts to get the most out of mod_perl. But
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> is still quite useful for making
an easy transition to mod_perl. With
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>, you can get a significant
performance improvement over mod_cgi with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Later, we will see that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>'s caching
mechanism is implemented by compiling each script in its own
namespace. <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> builds a unique
package name using the script's name, the current
URI, and the current virtual host (if any).
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> prepends a
<tt class="literal">package</tt>statement to your script, then compiles it
using Perl's <tt class="literal">eval</tt> function. In
<a href="ch06_01.html">Chapter 6</a>, we will show how exactly this is done.</p>

<p>What happens if you modify the script's file after
it has been compiled and cached? <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>
checks the file's last-modification time, and if the
file has changed since the last compile, it is reloaded and
recompiled.</p>

<p>In case of a compilation or execution error, the error is logged to
the server's error log, and a server error is
returned to the client.</p>
