that it can be difficult to keep your mod_perl processes from using a
lot of memory. The less memory you have, the fewer processes you can
run and the worse your server will perform, especially under a heavy
load. This chapter presents several common situations that can lead
to unnecessary consumption of RAM, together with preventive measures.</p><div class="sect1"><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">14.1. Controlling Your Memory Usage</h2>

<p>When you need to control the size of your <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>
processes, use one of the two modules,
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt>, which kill Apache
<em class="emphasis">httpd</em> processes when those processes grow too
large or lose a <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5188" />big chunk
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5189" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5190" />of their shared memory. The two modules
differ in their methods for finding out the memory usage.
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> relies on the
<tt class="literal">libgtop</tt> library to perform this task, so if this
library can be built on your platform you can use this module.
<tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt> includes different methods for
different platforms&#8212;you will have to check the
module's manpage to figure out which platforms are
supported.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.1. Defining the Minimum Shared Memory Size Threshold</h3>

<p>As we have already discussed, <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5191" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5192" />when
it is first created, an Apache child process usually has a large
fraction of its memory shared with its parent. During the child
process's life some of its data structures are
modified and a part of its memory becomes unshared (pages become
"dirty"), leading to an increase in
memory consumption. You will remember that the
<tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt> directive allows you to
specify the number of requests a child process should serve before it
is killed. One way to limit the memory consumption of a
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5193" />process is to kill it and let Apache
replace it with a newly started process, which again will have most
of its memory shared with the Apache parent. The new child process
will then serve requests, and eventually the cycle will be repeated.</p>

<p>This is a fairly crude means of limiting unshared memory, and you
will probably need to tune <tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt>,
eventually finding an optimum value. If, as is likely, your service
is undergoing constant changes, this is an inconvenient solution.
You'll have to retune this number again and again to
adapt to the ever-changing code base.</p>

<p>You really want to set some guardian to watch the shared size and
kill the process if it goes below some limit. This way, processes
will not be killed unnecessarily.</p>

<p>To set a shared memory lower limit of 4 MB using
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt>, add the following code into the
<em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::GTopLimit;
$Apache::GTopLimit::MIN_PROCESS_SHARED_SIZE = 4096;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and add this line to <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlFixupHandler Apache::GTopLimit</pre></blockquote>

<p>Don't forget to restart the server for the changes
to take effect.</p>

<p>Adding these lines has the effect that as soon as a child process
shares less than 4 MB of memory (the corollary being that it must
therefore be occupying a lot of memory with its unique pages), it
will be killed after completing its current request, and, as a
consequence, a new child will take its place.</p>

<p>If you use <tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt> you can accomplish
the same by adding this to <em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::SizeLimit;
$Apache::SizeLimit::MIN_SHARE_SIZE = 4096;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and this to <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlFixupHandler Apache::SizeLimit</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you want to set this limit for only some requests (presumably the
ones you think are likely to cause memory to become unshared), you
can register a post-processing check using the
<tt class="literal">set_min_shared_size( )</tt> function. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::GTopLimit;
if ($need_to_limit) {
    # make sure that at least 4MB are shared
    Apache::GTopLimit-&gt;set_min_shared_size(4096);
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>or for <tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::SizeLimit;
if ($need_to_limit) {
    # make sure that at least 4MB are shared
    Apache::SizeLimit-&gt;setmin(4096);
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since accessing the process information adds a little overhead, you
may want to check the process size only every <em class="emphasis">N</em>
times. In this case, set the
<tt class="literal">$Apache::GTopLimit::CHECK_EVERY_N_REQUESTS</tt>
variable. For example, to test the size every other time, put the
following in your <em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::GTopLimit::CHECK_EVERY_N_REQUESTS = 2;</pre></blockquote>

<p>or, for <tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::SizeLimit::CHECK_EVERY_N_REQUESTS = 2;</pre></blockquote>

<p>You can run the <tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> module in debug
mode by setting:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlSetVar Apache::GTopLimit::DEBUG 1</pre></blockquote>

<p>in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>. It's important
that this setting appears before the
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> module is loaded.</p>

<p>When debug mode is turned on, the module reports in the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file the memory usage of the current
process and also when it detects that at least one of the thresholds
was crossed and the process is going to be killed.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt> controls the debug level via the
<tt class="literal">$Apache::SizeLimit::DEBUG</tt> variable:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::SizeLimit::DEBUG = 1;</pre></blockquote>

<p>which can be modified any time, even after the module has been loaded.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-1.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">14.1.1.1. Potential drawbacks of memory-sharing restrictions</h3>

<p>In <a href="ch11_01.html">Chapter 11</a> we devised a formula to calculate the
optimum value for the <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> directive when
sharing is taking place. In the same section, we warned that
it's very important that the system not be heavily
engaged in swapping. Some systems do swap in and out every so often
even if they have plenty of real memory available, and
that's OK. The following discussion applies to
conditions when there is hardly any free memory available.</p>

<p>If the system uses almost all of its real memory (including the
cache), there is a danger of the parent process's
memory pages being swapped out (i.e., written to a swap device). If
this happens, the memory-usage reporting tools will report all those
swapped out pages as nonshared, even though in reality these pages
are still shared on most OSs. When these pages are getting swapped
in, the sharing will be reported back to normal after a certain
amount of time. If a big chunk of the memory shared with child
processes is swapped out, it's most likely that
<tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt> or
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> will notice that the shared
memory threshold was crossed and as a result kill those processes. If
many of the parent process's pages are swapped out,
and the newly created child process is already starting with shared
memory below the limit, it'll be killed immediately
after serving a single request (assuming that the
<tt class="literal">$CHECK_EVERY_N_REQUESTS</tt> variable is set to
<tt class="literal">1</tt>). This is a very bad situation that will
eventually lead to a state where the system won't
respond at all, as it'll be heavily engaged in the
swapping process.</p>

<p>This effect may be less or more severe depending on the memory
manager's implementation, and it certainly varies
from OS to OS and between kernel versions. Therefore, you should be
aware of this potential problem and simply try to avoid situations
where the system needs to swap at all, by adding more memory,
reducing the number of child servers, or spreading the load across
more machines (if reducing the number of child servers is not an
option because <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5194" />of the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5195" />request-rate demands).</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-1.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.2. Defining the Maximum Memory Size Threshold</h3>

<p>No less important than
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5196" />maximizing
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5197" />shared memory is restricting the absolute
size of the processes. If the processes grow after each request, and
if nothing restricts them from growing, you can easily run out of
memory.</p>

<p>Again you can set the <tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt>
directive to kill the processes after a few requests have been
served. But as we explained in the previous section, this solution is
not as good as one that monitors the process size and kills it only
when some limit is reached.</p>

<p>If you have <tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt> (described in the
previous section), you can limit a process's memory
usage by setting the
<tt class="literal">$Apache::GTopLimit::MAX_PROCESS_SIZE</tt> directive.
For example, if you want processes to be killed when they reach 10
MB, you should put the following in your
<em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::GTopLimit::MAX_PROCESS_SIZE = 10240;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Just as when limiting shared memory, you can set a limit for the
current process using the <tt class="literal">set_max_size( )</tt> method
in your code:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::GTopLimit;
Apache::GTopLimit-&gt;set_max_size(10000);</pre></blockquote>

<p>For <tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt>, the equivalents are:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::SizeLimit;
$Apache::SizeLimit::MAX_PROCESS_SIZE = 10240;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::SizeLimit;
Apache::SizeLimit-&gt;setmax(10240);</pre></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-1.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.1.3. Defining the Maximum Unshared Memory Size Threshold</h3>

<p>Instead of setting the shared and total memory usage thresholds, you
can set a single threshold that measures the amount of unshared
memory by subtracting the shared memory size from the total memory
size.</p>

<p>Both modules allow you to set the thresholds in similar ways. With
<tt class="literal">Apache::GTopLimit</tt>, you can set the unshared memory
threshold server-wide with:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::GTopLimit::MAX_PROCESS_UNSHARED_SIZE = 6144;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and locally for a handler with:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Apache::GTopLimit-&gt;set_max_unshared_size(6144);</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using <tt class="literal">Apache::SizeLimit</tt>, the
corresponding settings would be:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$Apache::SizeLimit::MAX_UNSHARED_SIZE = 6144;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Apache::SizeLimit-&gt;setmax_unshared(6144);</pre></blockquote>
