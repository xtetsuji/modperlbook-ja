as a database, as long as it allows us to store our data and retrieve
it later. There are many different kinds of databases. Some allow us
to store data and retrieve it years later; others are capable of
preserving data only while there is an electricity supply. Some
databases are designed for fast searches, others for fast insertions.
Some databases are very easy to use, while some are very complicated
(you may even have to learn a whole language to know how to operate
them). There are also large price differences.</p><p>When we choose a database for our application, we first need to
define the requirements in detail (this is known as a
<em class="emphasis">specification</em>). If the application is for
short-term use, we probably aren't going to use an
expensive, advanced database. A quick-and-dirty hack may do. If, on
the other hand, we design a system for long-term use, it makes sense
to take the time to find the ideal database implementation.</p><p>Databases can be of two kinds: volatile and non-volatile. These two
concepts pretty much relate to the two kinds of computer memory:
RAM-style memory, which usually loses all its contents when the
electricity supply is cut off; and magnetic (or optical) memory, such
as hard disks and compact discs, which can retain the information
even without power.</p><div class="sect1"><a name="pmodperl-CHP-17-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">17.1. Volatile Databases</h2>

<p>We use volatile databases all the time, even if we
don't think about them as real databases. These
databases are usually just part of the programs we run.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-17-SECT-1.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">17.1.1. In-Memory Databases in a Single Process</h3>

<p>If, for example, we want to store the number of Perl objects that
exist in our program's data, we can use a variable
as a volatile database:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">package Book::ObjectCounter;
use strict;
my $object_count = 0;
sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    $object_count++;
    return bless {  }, $class;
}
sub DESTROY {
    $object_count--;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example, <tt class="literal">$object_count</tt>serves as a
database&#8212;it stores the number of currently available objects.
When a new object is created this variable increments its value, and
when an object gets destroyed the value is decremented.</p>

<p>Now imagine a server, such as mod_perl, where the process can run for
months or even years without quitting. Doing this kind of accounting
is perfectly suited for the purpose, for if the process quits, all
objects are lost anyway, and we probably won't care
how many of them were alive when the process terminated.</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$DNS_CACHE{$dns} ||= dns_resolve($dns);
print "Hostname $dns has $DNS_CACHE{$dns} IP\n";</pre></blockquote>

<p>This little code snippet takes the hostname stored in
<tt class="literal">$dns</tt> and checks whether we have the corresponding
IP address cached in <tt class="literal">%DNS_CACHE</tt>. If not, it
resolves it and caches it for later reuse. At the end, it prints out
both the hostname and the corresponding IP address.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">%DNS_CACHE</tt>satisfies our definition of a database.
It's a volatile database, since when the program
quits the data disappears. When a mod_perl process quits, the cache
is lost, but there is a good chance that we won't
regret the loss, since we might want to cache only the latest IP
addresses anyway. Now if we want to turn this cache into a
non-volatile database, we just need to tie
<tt class="literal">%DNS_CACHE</tt> to a DBM file, and we will have a
permanent database. We will talk about Database Management (DBM)
files in <a href="ch19_01.html">Chapter 19</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="ch18_01.html">Chapter 18</a>, we will show how you can benefit
from this kind of in-process database under mod_perl. We will also
show how during a single request different handlers can share data
and how data can persist across many requests.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.1.2. In-Memory Databases Across Multiple Processes</h3>

<p>Sharing results is more efficient than having each child potentially
waste a lot of time generating redundant data. On the other hand, the
information may not be important enough, or have sufficient long-term
value, to merit being stored on disk. In this scenario, Inter-Process
Communication (IPC) is a useful tool to have around.</p>

<p>This topic is non-specific to mod_perl and big enough to fill several
books on its own. A non-exhaustive list of the modules to look at
includes <tt class="literal">IPC::SysV</tt>,
<tt class="literal">IPC::Shareable</tt>, <tt class="literal">IPC::Semaphore</tt>,
<tt class="literal">IPC::ShareLite</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Apache::Session</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">Cache::Cache</tt>. And of course make sure to read the
<tt class="literal">perlipc</tt> manpage. Also refer to the books listed in <a href="ch17_03.html#pmodperl-CHP-17-SECT-3">Section 17.3</a> at the end of this chapter.</p>
