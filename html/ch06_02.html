<h2 class="sect1">6.2. Exposing Apache::Registry Secrets</h2>

<p>Let's start with
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4322" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4323" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4324" />some
simple code and see what can go wrong with it. This simple CGI script
initializes a variable <tt class="literal">$counter</tt> to
<tt class="literal">0</tt> and prints its value to the browser while
incrementing it:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";

my $counter = 0;

for (1..5) {
    increment_counter( );
}

sub increment_counter {
    $counter++;
    print "Counter is equal to $counter !\n";
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>When issuing a request to <em class="emphasis">/perl/counter.pl</em> or a
similar script, we would expect to see the following output:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Counter is equal to 1 !
Counter is equal to 2 !
Counter is equal to 3 !
Counter is equal to 4 !
Counter is equal to 5 !</pre></blockquote>

<p>And in fact that's what we see when we execute this
script for the first time. But let's reload it a few
times.... After a few reloads, the counter suddenly stops counting
from 1. As we continue to reload, we see that it keeps on growing,
but not steadily, starting almost randomly at 10, 10, 10, 15, 20...,
which makes no sense at all!</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Counter is equal to 6 !
Counter is equal to 7 !
Counter is equal to 8 !
Counter is equal to 9 !
Counter is equal to 10 !</pre></blockquote>

<p>We saw two anomalies in this very simple script:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Unexpected increment of our counter over 5</p>
</li><li>
<p>Inconsistent growth over reloads</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The reason for this strange behavior is that although
<tt class="literal">$counter</tt> is incremented with each request, it is
never reset to 0, even though we have this line:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $counter = 0;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Doesn't this work under mod_perl?</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.2.1. The First Mystery: Why Does the Script Go Beyond 5?</h3>

<p>If we <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4325" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4326" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4327" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4328" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4329" />look at
the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file (we <em class="emphasis">did</em>
enable warnings), we'll see something like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Variable "$counter" will not stay shared 
at /home/httpd/perl/counter.pl line 13.</pre></blockquote>

<p>This warning is generated when a script contains a named (as opposed
to an anonymous) nested subroutine that refers to a lexically scoped
(with <tt class="literal">my( )</tt>) variable defined outside this nested
subroutine.</p>

<p>Do you see a nested named subroutine in our script? We
don't! What's going on? Maybe
it's a bug in Perl? But wait, maybe the Perl
interpreter sees the script in a different way! Maybe the code goes
through some changes before it actually gets executed? The easiest
way to check what's actually happening is to run the
script with a debugger.</p>

<p>Since we must debug the script when it's being
executed by the web server, a normal debugger won't
help, because the debugger has to be invoked from within the web
server. Fortunately, we can use Doug MacEachern's
<tt class="literal">Apache::DB</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4330" /> module to debug our script. While
<tt class="literal">Apache::DB</tt> allows us to debug the code
interactively (as we will show in <a href="ch21_01.html">Chapter 21</a>), we
will use it noninteractively in this example.</p>

<p>To enable the<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4331" /> debugger, modify the
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> file in the following way:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlSetEnv PERLDB_OPTS "NonStop=1 LineInfo=/tmp/db.out AutoTrace=1 frame=2"
PerlModule Apache::DB
&lt;Location /perl&gt;
    PerlFixupHandler Apache::DB
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    Options ExecCGI
    PerlSendHeader On
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>We have added a debugger configuration setting using the
<tt class="literal">PERLDB_OPTS</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4332" />
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4333" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4334" />environment
variable, which has the same effect as calling the debugger from the
command line. We have also loaded and enabled
<tt class="literal">Apache::DB</tt> as a
<tt class="literal">PerlFixupHandler</tt>.</p>

<p>In addition, we'll load the <tt class="literal">Carp</tt>
module, using <tt class="literal">&lt;Perl&gt;</tt>sections (this could
also be done in the <em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Perl&gt;
    use Carp;
&lt;/Perl&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>After applying the changes, we restart the server and issue a request
to <em class="emphasis">/perl/counter.pl</em>, as before. On the surface,
nothing has changed; we still see the same output as before. But two
things have happened in the background:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The file <em class="emphasis">/tmp/db.out</em> was written, with a
complete trace of the code that was executed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Since we have loaded the <tt class="literal">Carp</tt> module, the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file now contains the real code that
was actually executed. This is produced as a side effect of reporting
the "Variable
"$counter" will not stay shared
at..." warning that we saw earlier.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Here is the code that was actually executed:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">package Apache::ROOT::perl::counter_2epl;
use Apache qw(exit);
sub handler {
    BEGIN {
        $^W = 1;
    };
    $^W = 1;

    use strict;

    print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";

    my $counter = 0;

    for (1..5) {
        increment_counter( );
    }

    sub increment_counter {
        $counter++;
        print "Counter is equal to $counter !\n";
    }
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that the code in <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>
wasn't indented&#8212;we've
indented it to make it obvious that the code was wrapped inside the
<tt class="literal">handler( )</tt>subroutine.</p>

<p>From looking at this code, we learn that every
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>script is cached under a package
whose name is formed from the <tt class="literal">Apache::ROOT:</tt>:
prefix and the script's URI
(<em class="emphasis">/perl/counter.pl</em>) by replacing all occurrences
of <tt class="literal">/</tt> with <tt class="literal">:</tt>: and
. with <tt class="literal">_2e</tt>.
That's how mod_perl knows which script should be
fetched from the cache on each request&#8212;each script is
transformed into a package with a unique name and with a single
subroutine named <tt class="literal">handler( )</tt>, which includes all
the code that was originally in the script.</p>

<p>Essentially, what's happened is that because
<tt class="literal">increment_counter( )</tt> is a subroutine that refers
to a lexical variable defined outside of its scope, it has become a
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4335" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4336" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4337" /><em class="emphasis">closure</em>. Closures
don't normally trigger warnings, but in this case we
have a nested subroutine. That means that the first time the
enclosing subroutine <tt class="literal">handler( )</tt> is called, both
subroutines are referring to the same variable, but after that,
<tt class="literal">increment_counter( )</tt> will keep its own copy of
<tt class="literal">$counter</tt> (which is why <tt class="literal">$counter</tt>
is not <em class="emphasis">shared</em>) and increment its own copy.
Because of this, the value of <tt class="literal">$counter</tt> keeps
increasing and is never reset to 0.</p>

<p>If we were to use the
<tt class="literal">diagnostics</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4338" />
pragma in the script, which by default turns terse warnings into
verbose warnings, we would see a reference to an inner (nested)
subroutine in the text of the warning. By observing the code that
gets executed, it is clear that <tt class="literal">increment_counter(
)</tt> is a named nested subroutine since it gets defined inside
the <tt class="literal">handler( )</tt>subroutine.</p>

<p>Any subroutine defined in the body of the script executed under
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4339" /> becomes a nested subroutine. If the code
is placed into
a<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4340" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4341" /> library or a module that the
script <tt class="literal">require( )</tt>s or <tt class="literal">use( )</tt>s,
this effect doesn't occur.</p>

<p>For example, if we move the code from the script into the subroutine
<tt class="literal">run( )</tt>, place the subroutines in the
<em class="emphasis">mylib.pl</em> file, save it in the same directory as
the script itself, and <tt class="literal">require( )</tt> it, there will
be no problem at all.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-29">[29]</a>
Examples <a href="ch06_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-1">Example 6-1</a> and <a href="ch06_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-2">Example 6-2</a> show how we spread the code across the two
files.</p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-29" /><p> [29]Don't forget
the <tt class="literal">1;</tt> at the end of the library, or the
<tt class="literal">require( )</tt> call might fail.</p> </blockquote>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-1. mylib.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">my $counter;
sub run {
    $counter = 0;
    for (1..5) {
        increment_counter( );
    }
}
sub increment_counter {
    $counter++;
    print "Counter is equal to $counter !\n";
}
1;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-2" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-2. counter.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
require "./mylib.pl";
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
run( );</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>This solution is the easiest and fastest way to solve the nested
subroutine problem. All you have to do is to move the code into a
separate file, by first wrapping the initial code into some function
that you later call from the script, and keeping the lexically scoped
variables that could cause the problem out of this function.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it's best to put all the code in
external libraries (unless the script is very short) and have only a
few lines of code in the main script. Usually the main script simply
calls the main function in the library, which is often called
<tt class="literal">init( )</tt> or <tt class="literal">run( )</tt>. This way,
you don't have to worry about the effects of named
nested subroutines.</p>

<p>As we will show later in this chapter, however, this quick solution
might be problematic on a different front. If you have many scripts,
you might try to move more than one script's code
into a file with a similar filename, like
<em class="emphasis">mylib.pl</em>.
A<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4342" /> much cleaner solution would be to
spend a little bit more time on the porting process and use a fully
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4343" />qualified package, as in
Examples <a href="ch06_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-3">Example 6-3</a> and <a href="ch06_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-4">Example 6-4</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-3" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-3. Book/Counter.pm</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">package Book::Counter;

my $counter = 0;

sub run {
    $counter = 0;
    for (1..5) {
        increment_counter( );
    }
}

sub increment_counter {
    $counter++;
    print "Counter is equal to $counter !&lt;BR&gt;\n";
}

1;
_  _END_  _</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-4" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-4. counter-clean.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
use Book::Counter;

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
Book::Counter::run( );</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the only difference is in the package declaration. As
long as the package name is unique, you won't
encounter any collisions with other scripts running on the same
server.</p>

<p>Another solution to this problem is to change the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4344" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4345" />lexical variables to global
variables. There are two ways <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4346" />global variables can be used:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Using the <tt class="literal">vars</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4347" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4348" /> pragma. With the
<tt class="literal">use strict 'vars</tt>' setting, global variables can be
used after being declared with <tt class="literal">vars</tt>. For example,
this code:</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
use vars qw($counter $result);
# later in the code
$counter = 0;
$result  = 1;</pre></blockquote>

<p>is similar to this code if <tt class="literal">use strict</tt> is not used:</p>
<blockquote><pre class="code">$counter = 0;
$result  = 1;</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, the former style of coding is much cleaner, because it
allows you to use global variables by declaring them, while avoiding
the problem of misspelled variables being treated as undeclared
globals.</p>

<p>The only drawback to using <tt class="literal">vars</tt> is that each
global declared with it consumes more memory than the undeclared but
fully qualified globals, as we will see in the next item.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4349" />fully qualified variables. Instead of using
<tt class="literal">$counter</tt>, we can use
<tt class="literal">$Foo::counter</tt>, which will place the global
variable <tt class="literal">$counter</tt> into the package
<tt class="literal">Foo</tt>. Note that we don't know
which package name <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> will assign to
the script, since it depends on the location from which the script
will be called. Remember that globals must always be initialized
before they can be used.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Perl 5.6.x also introduces a third way, with the <tt class="literal">our(
)</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4350" /> declaration. <tt class="literal">our(
)</tt> can be used in different scopes, similar to <tt class="literal">my(
)</tt>, but it creates global variables.</p>

<p>Finally, it's possible to avoid this problem
altogether by always passing the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4351" />variables as arguments to the
functions (see <a href="ch06_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-5">Example 6-5</a>).</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-5" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-5. counter2.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";

my $counter = 0;

for (1..5) {
    $counter = increment_counter($counter);
}

sub increment_counter {
    my $counter = shift;

    $counter++;
    print "Counter is equal to $counter !\n";

    return $counter;
}</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>In this case, there is no variable-sharing problem. The drawback is
that this approach adds the overhead of passing and returning the
variable from the function. But on the other hand, it ensures that
your code is doing the right thing and is not dependent on whether
the functions are wrapped in other blocks, which is the case with the
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> handlers family.</p>

<p>When Stas (one of the authors of this book) had just started using
mod_perl and wasn't aware of the nested subroutine
problem, he happened to write a pretty complicated registration
program that was run under mod_perl. We will reproduce here only the
interesting part of that script:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI;
$q = CGI-&gt;new;
my $name = $q-&gt;param('name');
print_response( );

sub print_response {
    print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
    print "Thank you, $name!";
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Stas and his boss checked the program on the development server and
it worked fine, so they decided to put it in production. Everything
seemed to be normal, but the boss decided to keep on checking the
program by submitting variations of his profile using <em class="emphasis">The
Boss</em> as his username. Imagine his surprise when, after a
few successful submissions, he saw the response
"<em class="emphasis">Thank you,
Stas!</em>" instead of
"<em class="emphasis">Thank you, The
Boss!</em>"</p>

<p>After investigating the problem, they learned that they had been hit
by the nested subroutine problem. Why didn't they
notice this when they were trying the software on their development
server? We'll explain shortly.</p>

<p>To conclude this first mystery, remember to keep the
<tt class="literal">warnings</tt> mode <tt class="literal">On</tt> on the
development server and to watch the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>
file<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4352" /> for<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4353" /> <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4354" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4355" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4356" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4357" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4358" />warnings.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">6.2.2. The Second Mystery&#8212;Inconsistent Growth over Reloads</h3>

<p>Let's return to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4359" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4360" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4361" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4362" />our original example and
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4363" />proceed with the
second mystery we noticed. Why have we seen inconsistent results over
numerous reloads?</p>

<p>What happens is that each time the parent process gets a request for
the page, it hands the request over to a child process. Each child
process runs its own copy of the script. This means that each child
process has its own copy of <tt class="literal">$counter</tt>, which will
increment independently of all the others. So not only does the value
of each <tt class="literal">$counter</tt> increase independently with each
invocation, but because different children handle the requests at
different times, the increment seems to grow inconsistently. For
example, if there are 10 <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> children, the
first 10 reloads might be correct (if each request went to a
different child). But once reloads start reinvoking the script from
the child processes, strange results will appear.</p>

<p>Moreover, requests can appear at random since child processes
don't always run the same requests. At any given
moment, one of the children could have served the same script more
times than any other, while another child may never have run it.</p>

<p>Stas and his boss didn't discover the aforementioned
problem with the user registration system before going into
production because the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file was too
crowded with warnings continuously logged by multiple child
processes.</p>

<p>To immediately recognize the problem visually (so you can see
incorrect results), you need to run the server as a
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4364" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4365" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4366" />single process. You
can do this by invoking the server with the <em class="emphasis">-X</em>
option:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% httpd -X</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since there are no other servers (children) running, you will get the
problem report on the second reload.</p>

<p>Enabling the <tt class="literal">warnings</tt> mode (as explained earlier
in this chapter) and monitoring the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em>
file will help you detect most of the possible errors. Some warnings
can become errors, as we have just seen. You should check every
reported warning and eliminate it, so it won't
appear in <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> again. If your
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file is filled up with hundreds of
lines on every script invocation, you will have difficulty noticing
and locating real problems, and on a production server
you'll soon run out of disk space if your site is
popular.</p>
