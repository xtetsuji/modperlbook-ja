toady</em>"), an acronym for
"There's More Than One Way To Do
It," is the main motto of Perl. In other words, you
can reach the same goal (usually a working product) by coding in many
different styles, using different modules and deploying the same
modules in different ways.</p><p>However, when you come to the point where performance is the goal,
you might have to learn what's efficient and
what's not. This may mean that you will have to use
an approach that you don't really like,
that's less convenient, or that requires changing
your coding habits.</p><p>This section is about performance trade-offs. For almost every
comparison, we will provide the theoretical difference and then run
benchmarks to support the theory. No matter how good the theory is,
it's the numbers we get in practice that matter.</p><p>We also would like to mention that the code snippets used in the
benchmarks are meant to demonstrate the points we are making and are
intended to be as short and easy to understand as possible, rather
than being real-world examples.</p><p>In the following benchmarks, unless stated differently, mod_perl is
tested directly, and the following Apache configuration has been
used:</p><blockquote><pre class="code">MinSpareServers 10
MaxSpareServers 20
StartServers 10
MaxClients 20
MaxRequestsPerChild 10000</pre></blockquote><div class="sect1"><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">13.1. Apache::Registry PerlHandler Versus Custom PerlHandler</h2>

<p>At some point you have to decide whether to use
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> or similar handlers and stick to
writing scripts only for content generation, or to write pure Perl
handlers.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5074" /> maps a
request to a file and generates a package and the <tt class="literal">handler(
)</tt>subroutine to run the code contained in that file. If you
use a mod_perl handler instead of
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>, you have a direct mapping from
request to subroutine, without the steps in between. The steps that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> must go through include:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Run the <tt class="literal">stat( )</tt>system call on the
script's filename
(<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;filename</tt>).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Check that the file exists and is executable.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Generate a Perl package name based on the request's
URI (<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;uri</tt>).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change to the directory in which the script resides
(<tt class="literal">chdir</tt> <tt class="literal">basename</tt>
<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;</tt><em class="replaceable"><tt>filename</tt></em>).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Compare the file's last-modified time to the
compiled subroutine's last modified time as stored
in memory (if it has already been compiled).</p>
</li><li>
<p>If modified since the last compilation or not yet compiled, compile
the subroutine.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change back to the previous directory (<tt class="literal">chdir
$old_cwd</tt>).</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you remove these steps, you
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5075" />cut
out some overhead, plain and simple. Do you <em class="emphasis">need</em>
to cut out that overhead? Maybe yes, maybe no: it depends on your
performance requirements.</p>

<p>You should also take a look at the sister
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> modules (e.g.,
<tt class="literal">Apache::RegistryBB</tt>) that don't
perform all these steps, so you can still stick to using scripts to
generate the content. The greatest added value of scripts is that you
don't have to modify the configuration file to add
the handler configuration and restart the server for each newly
written content handler.</p>

<p>Another alternative is the
<tt class="literal">Apache::Dispatch</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5076" /> module (covered in <a href="appb_01.html">Appendix B</a>), which allows you to add new handlers and run
them without modifying the configuration.</p>

<p>Now let's run some benchmarks and compare.</p>

<p>We want to see the overhead that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5077" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5078" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5079" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5080" /> adds compared to a custom handler
and whether it becomes insignificant when used for heavy and
time-consuming code. In order to do this we will run two benchmark
sets: the first, the <em class="emphasis">light</em> set, will use an
almost empty script that sends only a basic header and one word of
content; the second will be the <em class="emphasis">heavy</em> set, which
adds some time-consuming operation to the script and handler code.</p>

<p>For the light set we will use the <em class="emphasis">registry.pl</em>
script running under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> (see <a href="ch13_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-13-EX-1">Example 13-1</a>).</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 13-1. benchmarks/registry.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use strict;
print "Content-type: text/plain\n\n";
print "Hello";</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>And we will use the equivalent content-generation handler, shown in
<a href="ch13_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-13-EX-2">Example 13-2</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-EX-2" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 13-2. Benchmark/Handler.pm</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">package Benchmark::Handler;
use Apache::Constants qw(:common);

sub handler {
    $r = shift;
    $r-&gt;send_http_header('text/plain');
    $r-&gt;print("Hello");
    return OK;
}
1;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>We will add these settings to <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlModule Benchmark::Handler
&lt;Location /benchmark_handler&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Benchmark::Handler
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first directive preloads and compiles the
<tt class="literal">Benchmark::Handler</tt> module. The remaining lines
tell Apache to execute the subroutine
<tt class="literal">Benchmark::Handler::handler</tt> when a request with
the relative URI <em class="emphasis">/benchmark_handler</em> is made.</p>

<p>We will use the usual configuration for
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>scripts, where all the URIs
starting with <em class="emphasis">/perl</em> are mapped to the files
residing under the <em class="emphasis">/home/httpd/perl</em> directory:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Alias /perl /home/httpd/perl
&lt;Location /perl&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler +Apache::Registry
    Options ExecCGI
    PerlSendHeader On
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>We will use <tt class="literal">Apache::RegistryLoader</tt> to preload and
compile the script at server startup as well, so the benchmark is
fair and only processing time is measured. To accomplish the
preloading we add the following code to the
<em class="emphasis">startup.pl</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::RegistryLoader ( );
Apache::RegistryLoader-&gt;new-&gt;handler(
            "/perl/benchmarks/registry.pl",
 "/home/httpd/perl/benchmarks/registry.pl");</pre></blockquote>

<p>To create the heavy benchmark set, let's leave the
preceding code examples unmodified but add some CPU-intensive
processing operation (e.g., an I/O operation or a database query):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $x = 100;
my $y = log ($x ** 100)  for (0..10000);</pre></blockquote>

<p>This code does lots of mathematical processing and is therefore very
CPU-intensive.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to proceed with the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5081" />benchmark.
We will generate 5,000 requests with a concurrency level of 15. Here
are the results:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">------------------------------
    name        | avtime   rps
------------------------------
light handler   |     15   911
light registry  |     21   680
------------------------------
heavy handler   |    183    81
heavy registry  |    191    77
------------------------------</pre></blockquote>

<p>First let's compare the results from the light set.
We can see that the average overhead added by
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> (compared to the custom handler)
is about:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">21 - 15 = 6 milliseconds</pre></blockquote>

<p>per request.</p>

<p>The difference in speed is about 40% (15 ms versus 21 ms). Note that
this doesn't mean that the difference in real-world
applications would be so big. The results of the heavy set confirm
this.</p>

<p>In the heavy set the average processing time is almost the same for
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> and the custom handler. You can
clearly see that the difference between the two is almost the same as
in the light set's results&#8212;it has grown from 6
ms to 8 ms (191 ms - 183 ms). This means that the identical heavy
code that has been added was running for about 168 ms (183 ms - 15
ms). However, this doesn't mean that the added code
itself ran for 168 ms; it means that it took 168 ms for this code to
be completed in a multiprocess environment where each process gets a
time slice to use the CPU. The more processes that are running, the
more time the process will have to wait to get the next time slice
when it can use the CPU.</p>

<p>We have answered the second question as well (whether the overhead of
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> is significant when used for
heavy code). You can see that when the code is not just the
<em class="emphasis">hello</em> script, the overhead added by
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> is almost insignificant.
It's not zero, though. Depending on your
requirements, this 5-10 ms overhead may be tolerable. If
that's the case, you may choose to use
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>.</p>

<p>An interesting observation is that when the server being tested runs
on a very slow machine the results are completely different:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">------------------------------
    name        | avtime   rps
------------------------------
light handler   |     50   196
light registry  |    160    61
------------------------------
heavy handler   |    149    67
heavy registry  |    822    12
------------------------------</pre></blockquote>

<p>First of all, the 6-ms difference in average processing time we saw
on the fast machine when running the light set has now grown to 110
ms. This means that the few extra operations that
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> performs turn out to be very
expensive on a slow machine.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can see that when the heavy set is used, the time
difference is no longer close to that found in the light set, as we
saw on the fast machine. We expected that the added code would take
about the same time to execute in the handler and the script.
Instead, we see a difference of 673 ms (822 ms - 149 ms).</p>

<p>The explanation lies in the fact that the difference between the
machines isn't merely in the CPU speed.
It's possible that there are many other things that
are different&#8212;for example, the size of the processor cache. If
one machine has a processor cache large enough to hold the whole
handler and the other doesn't, this can be very
significant, given that in our heavy benchmark set, 99.9% of the CPU
activity was dedicated to running the calculation code.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that none of the results and conclusions made here
should be taken for granted. Most likely you will see similar
behavior on your machine; however, only after you have run the
benchmarks and analyzed the results can you be sure of what is best
for your situation. If you later happen to use a different machine,
make sure you run the tests again, as they may lead to a completely
different decision (as we found when we tried the same benchmark on
different <a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5082" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5083" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5084" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-13-ITERM-5085" />machines).</p>
