<h2 class="sect1">6.9. Handling the "User Pressed Stop Button" Case</h2>

<p>When a user <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4558" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4559" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4560" />presses
the Stop or Reload button, the current socket connection is broken
(aborted). It would be nice if Apache could always immediately detect
this event. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell whether the
connection is still valid unless an attempt to read from or write to
the connection is made.</p>

<p>Note that no detection technique will work if the connection to the
backend mod_perl server is coming from a frontend mod_proxy (as
discussed in <a href="ch12_01.html">Chapter 12</a>). This is because
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4561" />mod_proxy
doesn't break the connection to the backend when the
user has aborted the connection.</p>

<p>If the reading of the request's data is completed
and the code does its processing without writing anything back to the
client, the broken connection won't be noticed. When
an attempt is made to send at least one character to the client, the
broken connection will be noticed and the <tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt>
signal (Broken Pipe) will be sent to the process. The program can
then halt its execution and perform all its cleanup requirements.</p>

<p>Prior to Apache 1.3.6, <tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt> was handled by
Apache. Currently, Apache does not handle <tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt>,
but mod_perl takes care of it.</p>

<p>Under mod_perl, <tt class="literal">$r-&gt;print</tt> (or just
<tt class="literal">print( )</tt>) returns a true value on success and a
false value on failure. The latter usually happens when the
connection is broken.</p>

<p>If you want behavior similar to the old
<tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4562" /> (as it was before Apache version
1.3.6), add the following configuration directive:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlFixupHandler Apache::SIG</pre></blockquote>

<p>When Apache's <tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt> handler is
used, Perl may be left in the middle of its <tt class="literal">eval(
)</tt> context, causing bizarre errors when subsequent requests
are handled by that child. When
<tt class="literal">Apache::SIG</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4563" /> is used, it installs a different
<tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt> handler that rewinds the context to make
sure Perl is in a normal state before the new request is served,
preventing these bizarre errors. But in general, you
don't need to use <tt class="literal">Apache::SIG</tt>.</p>

<p>If you use <tt class="literal">Apache::SIG</tt> and you would like to log
when a request was canceled by a <tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt> in your
Apache <em class="emphasis">access_log</em>, you must define a custom
<tt class="literal">LogFormat</tt> in your <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>.
For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlFixupHandler Apache::SIG
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b %{SIGPIPE}e"</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the server has noticed that the request was canceled via a
<tt class="literal">SIGPIPE</tt>, the log line will end with
<tt class="literal">1</tt>. Otherwise, it will just be a dash. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">127.0.0.1 - - [09/Jan/2001:10:27:15 +0100] 
"GET /perl/stopping_detector.pl HTTP/1.0" 200 16 1
127.0.0.1 - - [09/Jan/2001:10:28:18 +0100] 
"GET /perl/test.pl HTTP/1.0"              200 10 -</pre></blockquote>

<h3 class="sect2">6.9.1. Detecting Aborted Connections</h3>

<p>Now let's <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4564" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4565" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4566" />use the knowledge we have acquired
to trace the execution of the code and watch all the events as they
happen. Let's take a simple
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>script that purposely hangs the
server process, like the one in <a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-28">Example 6-28</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-28" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-28. stopping_detector.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">my $r = shift;
$r-&gt;send_http_header('text/plain');

print "PID = $$\n";
$r-&gt;rflush;

while (1) {
    sleep 1;
}</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The script gets a request object <tt class="literal">$r</tt> by
<tt class="literal">shift( )</tt> ing it from the <tt class="literal">@_</tt>
argument list (passed by the <tt class="literal">handler( )</tt>subroutine
that was created on the fly by <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt>).
Then the script sends a <tt class="literal">Content-Type</tt> header
telling the client that we are going to send a plain-text response.</p>

<p>Next, the script prints out a single line telling us the ID of the
process that handled the request, which we need to know in order to
run the tracing utility. Then we flush Apache's
<tt class="literal">STDOUT</tt> buffer. If we don't flush
the buffer, we will never see this information printed (our output is
shorter than the buffer size used for <tt class="literal">print( )</tt>,
and the script intentionally hangs, so the buffer
won't be auto-flushed).<a href="#FOOTNOTE-31">[31]</a></p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-31" /><p> [31]Buffering is
used to reduce the number of system calls (which do the actual
writing) and therefore improve performance. When the buffer (usually
a few kilobytes in size) is getting full, it's
flushed and the data is written.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Then we enter an infinite <tt class="literal">while</tt> loop that does
nothing but <tt class="literal">sleep( )</tt>, emulating code that
doesn't generate any output. For example, it might
be a long-running mathematical calculation, a database query, or a
search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Running <em class="emphasis">strace -p PID</em>, where
<em class="emphasis">PID</em> is the process ID as printed on the browser,
we see the following output printed every second:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [  ], 8)  = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [  ], NULL, 8)  = 0
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})                 = 0
time([978969822])                         = 978969822
time([978969822])                         = 978969822</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, we can run the server in single-server mode. In
single-server mode, we don't need to print the
process ID, since the PID is the process of the single mod_perl
process that we're running. When the process is
started in the background, the shell program usually prints the PID
of the process, as shown here:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% httpd -X &amp;
 [1] 20107</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now we know what process we have to attach to with
<em class="emphasis">strace</em> (or a similar utility):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% strace -p 20107
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [  ], 8)  = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [  ], NULL, 8)  = 0
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})                 = 0
time([978969822])                         = 978969822
time([978969822])                         = 978969822</pre></blockquote>

<p>We see the same output as before.</p>

<p>Let's leave <em class="emphasis">strace</em> running and
press the Stop button. Did anything change? No, the same system calls
trace is printed every second, which means that Apache
didn't detect the broken connection.</p>

<p>Now we are going to write <tt class="literal">\0</tt>
(<tt class="literal">NULL</tt>) characters to the client in an attempt to
detect the broken connection as soon as possible after the Stop
button is pressed. Since these are <tt class="literal">NULL</tt>
characters, they won't be seen in the output.
Therefore, we modify the loop code in the following way:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">while (1) {
    $r-&gt;print("\0");
    last if $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted;
    sleep 1;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>We add a <tt class="literal">print( )</tt>statement to print a
<tt class="literal">NULL</tt> character, then we check whether the
connection was aborted, with the help of the
<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted</tt> method. If the
connection is broken, we break out of the loop.</p>

<p>We run this script and run <em class="emphasis">strace</em> on it as
before, but we see that it still doesn't
work&#8212;the script doesn't stop when the Stop
button is pressed.</p>

<p>The problem is that we aren't flushing the buffer.
The <tt class="literal">NULL</tt> characters won't be
printed until the buffer is full and is autoflushed. Since we want to
try writing to the connection pipe all the time, we add an
<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;rflush( )</tt> call. <a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-29">Example 6-29</a> is a new version of the code.</p>

<p>Apache detects the broken pipe, as you can see from this snippet:</p>

is a critical issue with aborted scripts. For example, what happens
to locked resources, if there are any? Will they be freed or not? If
not, scripts using these resources and the same locking scheme might
hang forever, waiting for these resources to be freed.</p>

<p>And what happens if a file was opened and never closed? In some
cases, this might lead to a file-descriptor leakage. In the long run,
many leaks of this kind might make your system unusable: when all
file descriptors are used, the system will be unable to open new
files.</p>

<p>First, let's take a step back and recall what the
problems and solutions for these issues are under mod_cgi. Under
mod_cgi, the resource-locking issue is a problem only if you use
external lock files and use them for lock indication, instead of
using <tt class="literal">flock( )</tt>. If the script running under
mod_cgi is aborted between the lock and the unlock code, and you
didn't bother to write cleanup code to remove old,
dead locks, you're in big trouble.</p>

<p>The solution is to place the cleanup code in an
<tt class="literal">END</tt> block:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">END {
    # code that ensures that locks are removed
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>When the script is aborted, Perl will run the <tt class="literal">END</tt>
block while shutting down.</p>

<p>If you use <tt class="literal">flock( )</tt>, things are much simpler,
since all opened files will be closed when the script exits. When the
file is closed, the lock is removed as well&#8212;all the locked
resources are freed. There are systems where <tt class="literal">flock(
)</tt> is unavailable; on those systems, you can use
Perl's emulation of this function.</p>

<p>With mod_perl, things can be more complex when you use global
variables as filehandles. Because processes don't
exit after processing a request, files won't be
closed unless you explicitly <tt class="literal">close( )</tt> them or
reopen them with the <tt class="literal">open( )</tt> call, which first
closes the file. Let's see what problems we might
encounter and look at some possible solutions.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-SECT-9.2.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">6.9.2.1. Critical section</h3>

<p>First, we <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4574" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4575" />want to take a little detour to
discuss the "critical section"
issue. Let's start with a resource-locking scheme. A
schematic representation of a proper
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4576" />locking technique is as follows:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Lock a resource</p>

<p>&lt;critical section starts&gt;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do something with the resource</p>

<p>&lt;critical section ends&gt;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Unlock the resource</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the locking is exclusive, only one process can hold the resource
at any given time, which means that all the other processes will have
to wait. The code between the locking and unlocking functions cannot
be interrupted and can therefore become a service bottleneck.
That's why this code section is called critical. Its
execution time should be as short as possible.</p>

<p>Even if you use a shared locking scheme, in which many processes are
allowed to concurrently access the resource, it's
still important to keep the critical section as short as possible, in
case a process requires an exclusive lock.</p>

<p><a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-30">Example 6-30</a> uses a shared lock but has a poorly
designed critical section.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-30" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-30. critical_section_sh.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
use Symbol;

my $fh = gensym;
open $fh, "/tmp/foo" or die $!;

# start critical section
flock $fh, LOCK_SH;  # shared lock, appropriate for reading
seek $fh, 0, 0;
my @lines = &lt;$fh&gt;;
for (@lines) {
    print if /foo/;
}
close $fh; # close unlocks the file
# end critical section</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The code opens the file for reading, locks and rewinds it to the
beginning, reads all the lines from the file, and prints out the
lines that contain the string
"foo".</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">gensym( )</tt> function imported by the
<tt class="literal">Symbol</tt> module creates an anonymous glob data
structure and returns a reference to it. Such a glob reference can be
used as a file or directory handle. Therefore, it allows lexically
scoped variables to be used as filehandles.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Fcntl</tt> imports file-locking symbols, such as
<tt class="literal">LOCK_SH</tt>, <tt class="literal">LOCK_EX</tt>, and others
with the <tt class="literal">:flock</tt> group tag, into the
script's namespace. Refer to the
<tt class="literal">Fcntl</tt> manpage for more information about these
symbols.</p>

<p>If the file being read is big, it will take a relatively long time
for this code to complete printing out the lines. During this time,
the file remains open and locked with a shared lock. While other
processes may access this file for reading, any process that wants to
modify the file (which requires an exclusive lock) will be blocked
waiting for this section to complete.</p>

<p>We can optimize the
critical<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4577" /> section as follows. Once
the file has been read, we have all the information we need from it.
To make the example simpler, we've chosen to just
print out the matching lines. In reality, the code might be much
longer.</p>

<p>We don't need the file to be open while the loop
executes, because we don't access it inside the
loop. Closing the file before we start the loop will allow other
processes to obtain exclusive access to the file if they need it,
instead of being blocked for no reason.</p>

<p><a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-31">Example 6-31</a> is an improved version of the previous
example, in which we only read the contents of the file during the
critical section and process it afterward, without creating a
possible bottleneck.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-31" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-31. critical_section_sh2.pl</h4>

</div>

<p><a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-32">Example 6-32</a> is a similar example that uses an
exclusive lock. The script reads in a file and writes it back,
prepending a number of new text lines to the head of the file.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-32" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-32. critical_section_ex.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);

  );

seek $fh, 0, 0;
truncate $fh, 0;
print $fh @lines;
close $fh; # close unlocks the file
# end critical section</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Since we want to read the file, modify it, and write it back without
anyone else changing it in between, we open it for reading and
writing with the help of "<tt class="literal">+&gt;&gt;</tt>" and lock it
with an exclusive lock. You cannot safely accomplish this task by
opening the file first for reading and then reopening it for writing,
since another process might change the file between the two events.
(You could get away with "<tt class="literal">+&lt;</tt>" as well; please
refer to the <em class="emphasis">perlfunc</em> manpage for more
information about the <tt class="literal">open( )</tt> function.)</p>

<p>Next, the code prepares the lines of text it wants to prepend to the
head of the file and assigns them and the content of the file to the
<tt class="literal">@lines</tt> array. Now we have our data ready to be
written back to the file, so we <tt class="literal">seek( )</tt> to the
start of the file and <tt class="literal">truncate( )</tt> it to zero size.
Truncating is necessary when there's a chance the
file might shrink. In our example, the file always grows, so in this
case there is actually no need to truncate it; however,
it's good practice to always use <tt class="literal">truncate(
)</tt>, as you never know what changes your code might undergo
in the future, and <tt class="literal">truncate( )</tt>
doesn't significantly affect performance.</p>

<p>Finally, we write the data back to the file and close it, which
unlocks it as well.</p>

<p>Did you notice that we created the text lines to be prepended as
close to the place of usage as possible? This complies with good
"locality of code" style, but it
makes the critical section longer. In cases like this, you should
sacrifice style in order to make the critical section as short as
possible. An improved version of this script with a shorter critical
section is shown in <a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-33">Example 6-33</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-33" /><div class="example">

<p>There are two important differences. First, we prepared the text
lines to be prepended <em class="emphasis">before</em> the file is locked.
Second, rather than creating a new array and copying lines from one
array to another, we appended the file directly to the<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4578" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4579" />
<tt class="literal">@lines</tt> array.</p>

<h3 class="sect3">6.9.2.2. Safe resource locking and cleanup code</h3>

<p>Now let's get back to<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4580" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4581" /> this
section's main issue, safe resource locking. If you
don't make a habit of closing all files that you
open, you may encounter many problems (unless you use the
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt> handler, which does the cleanup
for you). An open file that isn't closed can cause
file-descriptor leakage. Since the number of file descriptors
available is finite, at some point you will run out of them and your
service will fail. This will happen quite fast on a heavily used
server.</p>

<p>You can use system utilities to observe the opened and locked files,
as well as the processes that have opened (and locked) the files. On
FreeBSD, use the <em class="emphasis">fstat</em> utility. On many other
Unix flavors, use <em class="emphasis">lsof</em>. On systems with a
<em class="emphasis">/proc</em> filesystem, you can see the opened file
descriptors under <em class="emphasis">/proc/PID/fd/</em>, where PID is
the actual process ID.</p>

<p>However, file-descriptor leakage is nothing compared to the trouble
you will give yourself if the code terminates and the file remains
locked. Any other process requesting a lock on the same file (or
resource) will wait indefinitely for it to become unlocked. Since
this will not happen until the server reboots, all processes trying
to use this resource will hang.</p>

<p><a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-34">Example 6-34</a> is an example of such a terrible mistake.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-34" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-34. flock.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
open IN, "+&gt;&gt;filename" or die "$!";
flock IN, LOCK_EX;
# do something
# quit without closing and unlocking the file</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Is this safe code? No&#8212;we forgot to close the file. So
let's add the <tt class="literal">close( )</tt>, as in
<a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-35">Example 6-35</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-35" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-35. flock2.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
open IN, "+&gt;&gt;filename" or die "$!";
flock IN, LOCK_EX;
# do something
close IN;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Is it safe code now? Unfortunately, it is not. If the user aborts the
request (for example, by pressing the browser's Stop
or Reload buttons) during the critical section, the script will be
aborted before it has had a chance to <tt class="literal">close( )</tt> the
file, which is just as bad as if we forgot to close it.</p>

<p>In fact, if the same process runs the same code again, an
<tt class="literal">open( )</tt> call will <tt class="literal">close( )</tt> the
file first, which will unlock the resource. This is because
<tt class="literal">IN</tt> is a global variable. But it's
quite possible that the process that created the lock will not serve
the same request for a while, since it might be busy serving other
requests. During that time, the file will be locked for other
processes, making them hang. So relying on the same process to reopen
the file is a bad idea.</p>

<p>This problem happens only if you use global variables as file
handles. <a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-36">Example 6-36</a> has the same problem.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-36" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-36. flock3.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
use Symbol ( );
use vars qw($fh);
$fh = Symbol::gensym( );
open $fh, "+&gt;&gt;filename" or die "$!";
flock $fh, LOCK_EX;
# do something
close $fh;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p><tt class="literal">$fh</tt> is still a global variable, and therefore the
code using it suffers from the same problem.</p>

<p>The simplest solution to this problem is to always use lexically
scoped variables (created with <tt class="literal">my( )</tt>). The
lexically scoped variable will always go out of scope (assuming that
it's not used in a closure, as explained in the
beginning of this chapter), whether the script gets aborted before
<tt class="literal">close( )</tt> is called or you simply forgot to
<tt class="literal">close( )</tt> the file. Therefore, if the file was
locked, it will be closed and unlocked. <a href="ch06_09.html#pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-37">Example 6-37</a>
is a good version of the code.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-EX-37" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 6-37. flock4.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Fcntl qw(:flock);
use Symbol ( );
my $fh = Symbol::gensym( );
open $fh, "+&gt;&gt;filename" or die "$!";
flock $fh, LOCK_EX;
# do something
close $fh;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>If you use this approach, please don't conclude that
you don't have to close files anymore because they
are automatically closed for you. Not closing files is bad style and
should be avoided.</p>

<p>Note also that Perl 5.6 provides a <tt class="literal">Symbol.pm</tt>-like
functionality as a built-in feature, so you can write:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">open my $fh, "&gt;/tmp/foo" or die $!;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and <tt class="literal">$fh</tt> will be automatically vivified as a valid
filehandle. You don't need to use
<tt class="literal">Symbol::gensym</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Apache::gensym</tt> anymore, if backward compatibility
is not a requirement.</p>

<p>You can also use <tt class="literal">IO::*</tt> modules, such as
<tt class="literal">IO::File</tt> or <tt class="literal">IO::Dir</tt>. These are
much bigger than the <tt class="literal">Symbol</tt> module (as a matter of
fact, these modules use the <tt class="literal">Symbol</tt> module
themselves) and are worth using for files or directories only if you
are already using them for the other features they provide. Here is
an example of their usage:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use IO::File;
use IO::Dir;
my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new("&gt;filename");
my $dh = IO::Dir-&gt;new("dirname");</pre></blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, there are also the lighter
<tt class="literal">FileHandle</tt> and <tt class="literal">DirHandle</tt>
modules.</p>

<p>If you still have to use global filehandles, there are a few
approaches you can take to clean up in the case of abnormal script
termination.</p>

<p>If you are running under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> and
friends, the <tt class="literal">END</tt> block will perform the cleanup
work for you. You can use <tt class="literal">END</tt> in the same way for
scripts running under mod_cgi, or in plain Perl scripts. Just add the
cleanup code to this block, and you are safe.</p>

<p>For example, if you work with DBM files, it's
important to flush the DBM buffers by calling a <tt class="literal">sync(
)</tt> method:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">END {
    # make sure that the DB is flushed
    $dbh-&gt;sync( );
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Under mod_perl, the above code will work only for
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> and
<tt class="literal">Apache::PerlRun</tt>scripts. Otherwise, execution of
the <tt class="literal">END</tt> block is postponed until the process
terminates. If you write a handler in the mod_perl API, use the
<tt class="literal">register_cleanup( )</tt> method instead. It accepts a
reference to a subroutine as an argument. You can rewrite the DBM
synchronization code in this way:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$r-&gt;register_cleanup(sub { $dbh-&gt;sync( ) });</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will work under <tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> as well.</p>

<p>Even better would be to check whether the client connection has been
aborted. Otherwise, the cleanup code will always be executed, and for
normally terminated scripts, this may not be what you want. To
perform this check, use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$r-&gt;register_cleanup(
  # make sure that the DB is flushed
  sub {
      $dbh-&gt;sync( ) if Apache-&gt;request-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted( );
  }
);</pre></blockquote>

<p>Or, if using an <tt class="literal">END</tt> block, use:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">END {
    # make sure that the DB is flushed
    $dbh-&gt;sync( ) if Apache-&gt;request-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted( );
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that if you use <tt class="literal">register_cleanup( )</tt>, it
should be called at the beginning of the script or as soon as the
variables you want to use in this code become available. If you use
it at the end of the script, and the script happens to be aborted
before this code is reached, no cleanup will be performed.</p>

<p>For example, <tt class="literal">CGI.pm</tt> registers a cleanup subroutine
in its <tt class="literal">new( )</tt> method:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sub new {
  # code snipped
  if ($MOD_PERL) {
      Apache-&gt;request-&gt;register_cleanup(\&amp;CGI::_reset_globals);
      undef $NPH;
  }
  # more code snipped
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Another way to register a section of cleanup code for mod_perl API
handlers is to use <tt class="literal">PerlCleanupHandler</tt> in the
configuration file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;Location /foo&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler        Apache::MyModule
    PerlCleanupHandler Apache::MyModule::cleanup( )
    Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::MyModule::cleanup</tt> <a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4582" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4583" />performs<a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4584" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4585" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4586" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-6-ITERM-4587" /> the cleanup.</p>
