<h2 class="sect1">17.2. Non-Volatile Databases</h2>

<p>Some information is so important that you cannot afford to lose it.
Consider the name and password for authenticating users. If a person
registers at a site that charges a subscription fee, it would be
unfortunate if his subscription details were lost the next time the
web server was restarted. In this case, the information must be
stored in a non-volatile way, and that usually means on disk. Several
options are available, ranging from flat files to DBM files to
fully-fledged relational databases. Which one you choose will depend
on a number of factors, including:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>The size of each record and the volume of the data to be stored</p>
</li><li>
<p>The number of concurrent accesses (to the server or even to the same
data)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Data complexity (do all the records fit into one row, or are there
relations between different kinds of record?)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Budget (some database implementations are great but very expensive)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Failover and backup strategies (how important it is to avoid
downtime, how soon the data must be restored in the case of a system
failure)</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 class="sect2">17.2.1. Flat-File Databases</h3>

<p>If we have a small amount of data, sometimes the easiest technique is
to just write this data in a text file. For example, if we have a few
records with a fixed number of fields we can store them in a file,
having one record per row and separating the fields with a delimiter.
For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Eric|Cholet|cholet@logilune.com
Doug|MacEachern|dougm@pobox.com
Stas|Bekman|stas@stason.org</pre></blockquote>

<p>As long as we have just a few records, we can quickly insert, edit,
and remove records by reading the flat-file database line by line and
adjusting things as required. We can retrieve the fields easily by
using the <tt class="literal">split</tt> function:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">@fields = split /\|/, $record;</pre></blockquote>

<p>and we can put them back using <tt class="literal">join</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$record = join '|', @fields;</pre></blockquote>

<p>However, we must make sure that no field uses the field separator we
have chosen (<em class="emphasis">|</em> in this case), and we must lock
the file if it is to be used in a multiprocess environment where many
processes may try to modify the same file simultaneously. This is the
case whether we are using mod_perl or not.</p>

<p>If we are using some flavor of Unix, the
<em class="emphasis">/etc/passwd</em> file is a perfect example of a
flat-file database, since it has a fixed number of fields and most
systems have a relatively small number of users.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-46">[46]</a> This is an example of such a file:</p>
<blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-46" /><p> [46]Disregard the fact that the actual password is stored in
<em class="emphasis">/etc/shadow</em> on modern systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre class="code">root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/tcsh
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:
lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:</pre></blockquote>

<p>: is used to separate the various fields.</p>

<p>Working with flat-file databases is easy and straightforward in plain
Perl. There are no special mod_perl tricks involved.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.2.2. Filesystem Databases</h3>

<p>Many people don't realize that in some cases, the
filesystem can serve perfectly well as a database. In fact, you are
probably using this kind of database every day on your PC&#8212;for
example, if you store your MP3 files categorized by genres, artists,
and albums. If we run:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% cd /data/mp3
panic% find .</pre></blockquote>

<p>We can see all the MP3 files that we have under
<em class="emphasis">/data/mp3</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">./Rock/Bjork/MTV Unplugged/01 - Human Behaviour.mp3
./Rock/Bjork/MTV Unplugged/02 - One Day.mp3
./Rock/Bjork/MTV Unplugged/03 - Come To Me.mp3
...
./Rock/Bjork/Europa/01 - Prologue.mp3
./Rock/Bjork/Europa/02 - Hunter.mp3
...
./Rock/Nirvana/MTV Unplugged/01 - About A Girl.mp3
./Rock/Nirvana/MTV Unplugged/02 - Come As You Are.mp3
...
./Jazz/Herbie Hancock/Head Hunters/01 - Chameleon.mp3
./Jazz/Herbie Hancock/Head Hunters/02 - Watermelon Man.mp3</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now if we want to query what artists we have in the Rock genre, we
just need to list the files in the <em class="emphasis">Rock/</em>
directory. Once we find out that Bjork is one of the artists in the
Rock category, we can do another enquiry to find out what Bjork
albums we have bought by listing the files under the
<em class="emphasis">Rock/Bjork/</em> directory. Now if we want to see the
actual MP3 files from a particular album (e.g., <em class="emphasis">MTV
Unplugged</em>), we list the files under that directory.</p>

<p>What if we want to find all the albums that have
<em class="emphasis">MTV</em> in their names? We can use
<tt class="literal">ls</tt> to give us all the albums and MP3 files:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% ls -l ./*/*/*MTV*</pre></blockquote>

<p>Of course, filesystem manipulation can be done from your Perl program.</p>

<p>Let's look at another example. If you run a site
about rock groups, you might want to store images relating to
different groups. Using the filesystem as a database is a perfect
match. Chances are these images will be served to users via
<tt class="literal">&lt;img&gt;</tt> tags, so it makes perfect sense to use
the real path (<tt class="literal">DocumentRoot</tt> considerations aside)
to the image. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">&lt;img src="/images/rock/ACDC/cover-front.gif" alt="ACDC" ...&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/rock/ACDC/cover-back.gif"  alt="ACDC" ...&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example we treat <em class="emphasis">ACDC</em> as a record and
<em class="emphasis">cover-front.gif</em> and
<em class="emphasis">cover-back.gif</em> as fields. This database
implementation, just like the flat-file database, has no special
benefits under mod_perl, so we aren't going to
expand on the idea, but it's worth keeping in mind.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-17-SIDEBAR-1" /><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="6"><tr><td>
<h4 class="objtitle">Too Many Files</h4>

<p>There is one thing to beware of: in some operating systems, when too
many files (or directories) are stored in a single directory, access
can be sluggish. It depends on the filesystem you are using. If you
have a few files, simple linear access will be good enough. Many
filesystems employ hashing algorithms to store the i-nodes (files or
directories) of a directory. You should check your filesystem
documentation to see how it will behave under load.</p>

<p>If you find that you have lots of files to store and the filesystem
implementation won't work too well for you, you can
implement your own scheme by spreading the files into an extra layer
or two of subdirectories. For example, if your filenames are numbers,
you can use something like the following function:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $dir = join "/", (split '', sprintf "%02d", $id)[0..1], $id;</pre></blockquote>

<p>So if you want to create a directory <em class="emphasis">12345</em>, it
will be converted into <em class="emphasis">1/2/12345</em>. The directory
<em class="emphasis">12</em> could become <em class="emphasis">0/0/12</em>, and
<em class="emphasis">124</em> could become <em class="emphasis">0/1/124</em>.
If your files have a reasonable distribution, which is often true
with numerical data, you might end up with two-llevel hashing. So if
you have 10,000 directories to create, each end-level directory will
have at most about 100 subdirectories, which is probably good enough
for a fast lookup. If you are going to have many more files you may
need to think about adding more levels.</p>

<p>Also remember that the more levels you add, the more overhead you are
adding, since the OS has to search through all the intermediate
directories that you have added. Only do that if you really need to.
If you aren't sure, and you start with a small
number of directories, abstract the resolution of the directories so
that in the future you can switch to a hashed implementation or add
more levels to the existing one.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.2.3. DBM Databases</h3>

<p>DBM databases are very similar to flat-file databases, but if all you
need is to store the key/value pairs, they will do it much faster.
Their use is much simpler, too. Perl uses <tt class="literal">tie( )</tt>
to interact with DBM databases, and you work with these files as with
normal hash data structures. When you want to store a value, you just
assign it to a hash tied to the DBM database, and to retrieve some
data you just read from the hash.</p>

<p>A good example is session tracking: any user can connect to any of
several mod_perl processes, and each process needs to be able to
retrieve the session ID from any other process. With DBM this task is
trivial. Every time a lookup is needed, tie the DBM file, get the
shared lock, and look up the <em class="emphasis">session_id</em> there.
Then retrieve the data and untie the database. Each time you want to
update the session data, you tie the database, acquire an exclusive
lock, update the data, and untie the database. It's
probably not the fastest approach, and probably not the best one if
you need to store more than a single scalar for each record, but it
works quite well.</p>

<p>In <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20</a> we give some important background
information about DBM files and provide a few examples of how you can
benefit from usingDBM files under mod_perl.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">17.2.4. Relational Databases</h3>

<p>Of course, the most advanced solution is a relational database. But
even though it provides the best solution in many cases,
it's not always the one you should pick. You
don't need a sledgehammer to crack a nut, right?</p>

<p>Relational databases come in different implementations. Some are very
expensive and provide many tools and extra features that
aren't available with the cheaper and free
implementations. What's important to keep in mind is
that it's not necessarily the most expensive one
that is the best choice in a given situation. Just as you need to
choose the right database structure, you need to choose the right
relational database. For example, ask yourself whether you need
speed, or support for transactions, or both.</p>

<p>It makes sense to try to write your code in such a way that if later
in the course of development you discover that your choice of
relational database wasn't the best, it will be easy
to switch to a different one.</p>

<p>mod_perl greatly helps work with relational databases, mainly because
it allows persistent database connections. We'll
talk extensively about relational databases and mod_perl in <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20</a>.</p>
