<h2 class="sect1">12.7. Apache's mod_proxy Module</h2>

<p>Apache's mod_proxy <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4986" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4987" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4988" />module
implements a proxy and cache for Apache. It implements proxying
capabilities for the following protocols: FTP, CONNECT (for SSL),
HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, and HTTP/1.1. The module can be configured to
connect to other proxy modules for these and other protocols.</p>

<p>mod_proxy is part of Apache, so there is no need to install a
separate server&#8212;you just have to enable this module during the
Apache build process or, if you have Apache compiled as a DSO, you
can compile and add this module after you have completed the build of
Apache.</p>

<p>A setup with a mod_proxy-enabled server and a mod_perl-enabled server
is depicted in <a href="ch12_07.html#pmodperl-CHP-12-FIG-6">Figure 12-6</a>.</p>

<p>We do not think the difference in speed between
Apache's mod_proxy and Squid is relevant for most
sites, since the real value of what they do is buffering for slow
client connections. However, Squid runs as a single process and
probably consumes fewer system resources.</p>

<p>The trade-off is that mod_rewrite is easy to use if you want to
spread parts of the site across different backend servers, while
mod_proxy knows how to fix up redirects containing the backend
server's idea of the location. With Squid you can
run a redirector process to proxy to more than one backend, but there
is a problem in fixing redirects in a way that keeps the
client's view of both server names and port numbers
in all cases.</p>

<p>The difficult case is where you have DNS aliases that map to the same
IP address, you want them redirected to port 80 (although the server
is on a different port), and you want to keep the specific name the
browser has already sent so that it does not change in the
client's browser's location window.</p>

<p>The advantages of mod_proxy are:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>No additional server is needed. We keep the plain one plus one
mod_perl-enabled Apache server. All you need is to enable mod_proxy
in the <em class="emphasis">httpd_docs</em> server and add a few lines to
the <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> file.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ProxyPass        /perl/ http://localhost:81/perl/
ProxyPassReverse /perl/ http://localhost:81/perl/</pre></blockquote>

<p>The <tt class="literal">ProxyPass</tt> directive triggers the proxying
process. A request for <em class="emphasis">http://example.com/perl/</em>
is proxied by issuing a request for
<em class="emphasis">http://localhost:81/perl/</em> to the mod_perl
server. mod_proxy then sends the response to the client. The URL
rewriting is transparent to the client, except in one case: if the
mod_perl server issues a redirect, the URL to redirect to will be
specified in a <tt class="literal">Location</tt> header in the response.
This is where <tt class="literal">ProxyPassReverse</tt> kicks in: it scans
<tt class="literal">Location</tt> headers from the responses it gets from
proxied requests and rewrites the URL before forwarding the response
to the client.</p>
</li><li>
<p>It buffers mod_perl output like Squid does.</p>
</li><li>
<p>It does caching, although you have to produce correct
<tt class="literal">Content-Length</tt>, <tt class="literal">Last-Modified</tt>,
and <tt class="literal">Expires</tt> HTTP headers for it to work. If some
of your dynamic content does not change frequently, you can
dramatically increase performance by caching it with mod_proxy.</p>
</li><li>
<p><tt class="literal">ProxyPass</tt> happens before the authentication phase,
so you do not have to worry about authenticating twice.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apache is able to accelerate secure HTTP requests completely, while
also doing accelerated HTTP. With Squid you have to use an external
redirection program for that.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The latest mod_proxy module (for Apache 1.3.6 and later) is reported
to be <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4989" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4990" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4991" />very stable.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">12.7.1. Concepts and Configuration Directives</h3>

<p>In the following explanation, we will use
<em class="emphasis">www.example.com</em> as the main server users access
when they want to get some kind of service and
<em class="emphasis">backend.example.com</em> as the machine that does the
heavy work. The main and backend servers are different; they may or
may not coexist on the same machine.</p>

<p>We'll use the mod_proxy module built into the main
server to handle requests to <em class="emphasis">www.example.com</em>.
For the sake of this discussion it doesn't matter
what functionality is built into the
<em class="emphasis">backend.example.com</em> server&#8212;obviously
it'll be mod_perl for most of us, but this technique
can be successfully applied to other web programming languages (PHP,
Java, etc.).</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-SECT-7.1.1" /><div class="sect3">
<h3 class="sect3">12.7.1.1. ProxyPass</h3>

<p>You can<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4992" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4993" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4994" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4995" /> use the <tt class="literal">ProxyPass</tt>
configuration directive to map remote hosts into the URL space of the
local server; the local server does not act as a proxy in the
conventional sense, but appears to be a mirror of the remote server.</p>

<p>Let's explore what this rule does:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ProxyPass   /perl/ http://backend.example.com/perl/</pre></blockquote>

<p>When a user initiates a request to
<em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com/perl/foo.pl</em>, the request
is picked up by mod_proxy. It issues a request for
<em class="emphasis">http://backend.example.com/perl/foo.pl</em> and
forwards the response to the client. This reverse proxy process is
mostly transparent to the client, as long as the response data does
not contain absolute URLs.</p>

<p>One such situation occurs when the backend server issues a redirect.
The URL to redirect to is provided in a <tt class="literal">Location</tt>
header in the response. The backend server will use its own
<tt class="literal">ServerName</tt> and <tt class="literal">Port</tt> to build
the URL to redirect to. For example, mod_dir will redirect a request
for <em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com/somedir/</em> to
<em class="emphasis">http://backend.example.com/somedir/</em> by issuing a
redirect with the following header:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Location: http://backend.example.com/somedir/</pre></blockquote>

<p>Since <tt class="literal">ProxyPass</tt> forwards the response unchanged to
the client, the user will see
<em class="emphasis">http://backend.example.com/somedir/</em> in her
browser's location window, instead of
<em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com/somedir/</em>.</p>

<p>You have probably noticed many examples of this from real-life web
sites you've visited. Free email service providers
and other similar heavy online services display the login or the main
page from their main server, and then when you log in you see
something like <em class="emphasis">x11.example.com</em>, then
<em class="emphasis">w59.example.com</em>, etc. These are the backend
servers that do the actual work.</p>

<p>Obviously this is not an ideal solution, but since users
don't usually care about what they see in the
location window, you can sometimes get away with this approach. In
the following section we show a better solution that solves this
issue and provides even more useful functionalities.</p>

<p>This
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4996" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4997" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4998" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-4999" />directive lets Apache adjust the URL
in the <tt class="literal">Location</tt> header on HTTP redirect responses.
This is essential when Apache is used as a reverse proxy to avoid
bypassing the reverse proxy because of HTTP redirects on the backend
servers. It is generally used in conjunction with the
<tt class="literal">ProxyPass</tt> directive to build a complete frontend
proxy server.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ProxyPass          /perl/  http://backend.example.com/perl/
ProxyPassReverse   /perl/  http://backend.example.com/perl/</pre></blockquote>

<p>When a user initiates a request to
<em class="emphasis">http://www.example.com/perl/foo</em>, the request is
proxied to <em class="emphasis">http://backend.example.com/perl/foo</em>.
Let's say the backend server responds by issuing a
redirect for
<em class="emphasis">http://backend.example.com/perl/foo/</em> (adding a
trailing slash). The response will include a
<tt class="literal">Location</tt> header:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Location: http://backend.example.com/perl/foo/</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">ProxyPassReverse</tt> on the frontend server will
rewrite this header to:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Location: http://www.example.com/perl/foo/</pre></blockquote>

<p>This happens completely transparently. The end user is never aware of
the URL rewrites happening behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Note that this <tt class="literal">ProxyPassReverse</tt> directive can also
be used in conjunction with the proxy pass-through feature of
mod_rewrite, described later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">12.7.2. Knowing the Proxypassed Connection Type</h3>

<p>Let's say <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5004" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5005" />that you have a frontend server running
mod_ssl, mod_rewrite, and mod_proxy. You want to make sure that your
user is using a secure connection for some specific actions, such as
login information submission. You don't want to let
the user log in unless the request was submitted through a secure
port.</p>

<p>Since you have to proxypass the request between the frontend and
backend servers, you cannot know where the connection originated. The
HTTP headers cannot reliably provide this information.</p>

<p>A possible solution for this problem is to have the mod_perl server
listen on two different ports (e.g., 8000 and 8001) and have the
mod_rewrite proxy rule in the regular server redirect to port 8000
and the mod_rewrite proxy rule in the SSL virtual host redirect to
port 8001. Under the mod_perl server, use
<tt class="literal">$r-&gt;connection-&gt;port</tt> or the environment
variable <tt class="literal">PORT</tt> to tell if the connection is secure.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">12.7.3. Buffering Feature</h3>

<p>In addition to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5006" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5007" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5008" />correcting
the URI on its way back from the backend server, mod_proxy, like
Squid, also provides buffering services that benefit mod_perl and
similar heavy modules. The buffering feature allows mod_perl to pass
the generated data to mod_proxy and move on to serve new requests,
instead of waiting for a possibly slow client to receive all the
data.</p>

<p><a href="ch12_07.html#pmodperl-CHP-12-FIG-7">Figure 12-7</a> depicts this feature.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-FIG-7" /><div class="figure"><img src="figs/pmp_1207.gif" alt="Figure 12-7" width="464" /></div><h4 class="objtitle">Figure 12-7. mod_proxy buffering</h4>

<p>mod_perl streams the generated response into the kernel send buffer,
which in turn goes into the kernel receive buffer of mod_proxy via
the TCP/IP connection. mod_proxy then streams the file into the
kernel send buffer, and the data goes to the client over the TCP/IP
connection. There are four buffers between mod_perl and the client:
two kernel send buffers, one receive buffer, and finally the
mod_proxy user space buffer. Each of those buffers will take the data
from the previous stage, as long as the buffer is not full. Now
it's clear that in order to immediately release the
mod_perl process, the generated response should fit into these four
buffers.</p>

<p>If the data doesn't fit immediately into all
buffers, mod_perl will wait until the first kernel buffer is emptied
partially or completely (depending on the OS implementation) and then
place more data into it. mod_perl will repeat this process until the
last byte has been placed into the buffer.</p>

<p>The kernel's receive buffers
(<em class="emphasis">recvbuf</em>) and send buffers
(<em class="emphasis">sendbuf</em>) are used for different things: the
receive buffers are for TCP data that hasn't been
read by the application yet, and the send buffers are for application
data that hasn't been sent over the network yet. The
kernel buffers actually seem smaller than their declared size,
because not everything goes to actual TCP/IP data. For example, if
the size of the buffer is 64 KB, only about 55 KB or so can actually
be used for data. Of course, the overhead varies from OS to OS.</p>

<p>It might not be a very good idea to increase the
kernel's receive buffer too much, because you could
just as easily increase mod_proxy's user space
buffer size and get the same effect in terms of buffering capacity.
Kernel memory is <em class="emphasis">pinned</em> (not swappable), so
it's harder on the system to use a lot of it.</p>

<p>The user space buffer size for mod_proxy seems to be fixed at 8 KB,
but changing it is just a matter of replacing
<tt class="literal">HUGE_STRING_LEN</tt> with something else in
<em class="emphasis">src/modules/proxy/proxy_http.c</em> under the Apache
source distribution.</p>

<p>mod_proxy's receive buffer is configurable by the
<tt class="literal">ProxyReceiveBufferSize</tt> parameter. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ProxyReceiveBufferSize 16384</pre></blockquote>

<p>will create a buffer 16 KB in size.
<tt class="literal">ProxyReceiveBufferSize</tt> must be bigger than or
equal to 512 bytes. If it's not set or is set to
<tt class="literal">0</tt>, the system default will be used. The number
it's set to should be an integral multiple of 512.
<tt class="literal">ProxyReceiveBufferSize</tt> cannot be bigger than the
kernel receive buffer size; if you set the value of
<tt class="literal">ProxyReceiveBufferSize</tt> larger than this size, the
default value will be used (a warning will be printed in this case by
mod_proxy).</p>

<p>You can modify the source code to adjust the size of the
server's internal read-write buffers by changing the
definition of <tt class="literal">IOBUFSIZE</tt> in
<em class="emphasis">include/httpd.h</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you cannot set the kernel buffers'
sizes as large as you might want because there is a limit to the
available physical memory and OSes have their own upper limits on the
possible buffer size. To increase the physical memory limits, you
have to add more RAM. You can change the OS limits as well, but these
procedures are very specific to OSes. Here are some of the OSes and
the procedures to increase their socket buffer sizes:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>Linux</i></dt>
<dd>
For 2.2<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5009" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5010" /> kernels, the maximum
limit for receive buffer size is set in
<em class="emphasis">/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</em></tt> and the default
value is in <em class="emphasis">/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default</em></tt>. If
you want to increase the <em class="emphasis">rcvbuf</em></tt>size above
65,535 bytes, the default maximum value, you have to first raise the
absolute limit in <em class="emphasis">/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</em></tt>.
At runtime, execute this command to raise it to 128 KB:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic# echo 131072 &gt; /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</pre></blockquote>

<p>You probably want to put this command into
<em class="emphasis">/etc/rc.d/rc.local</em></tt> (or elsewhere, depending on
the operating system and the distribution) or a similar script that
is executed at server startup, so the change will take effect at
system reboot.</p>

<p>For the 2.2.5 kernel, the maximum and default values are either 32 KB
or 64 KB. You can also change the default and maximum values during
kernel compilation; for that, you should alter the
<tt class="literal">SK_RMEM_DEFAULT</tt> and <tt class="literal">SK_RMEM_MAX</tt>
definitions, respectively. (Since kernel source files tend to change,
use the <em class="emphasis">grep(1)</em></tt> utility to find the files.)</p>

<p>The same applies for the write buffers. You need to adjust
<em class="emphasis">/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max</em></tt> and possibly the
default value in
<em class="emphasis">/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default</em></tt>. If you want to
adjust the kernel configuration, you have to adjust the
<tt class="literal">SK_WMEM_DEFAULT</tt> and <tt class="literal">SK_WMEM_MAX</tt>
definitions, respectively.</p>

Under<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5011" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5012" /> FreeBSD

default value is 256 KB.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>This buffering technique applies only to <em class="emphasis">downstream
data</em></tt> (data coming from the origin server to the proxy),
not to upstream data. When the server gets an incoming stream,
because a request has been issued, the first bits of data hit the
mod_perl server immediately. Afterward, if the request includes a lot
of data (e.g., a big <tt class="literal">POST</tt> request, usually a file
upload) and the client has a slow connection, the mod_perl process
will stay tied, waiting for all the data to come in (unless it
decides to abort the request for some reason). Falling back on
mod_cgi seems to be the best solution for specific scripts whose
major function is receiving large amounts of upstream data. Another
alternative is to use yet another mod_perl server, which will be
dedicated to file uploads only, and have it serve those specific URIs
through correct proxy <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5015" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5016" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5017" />configuration.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">lingerd</tt> is a daemon (service) designed to take
over the job of properly closing network connections from an HTTP
server such as Apache and immediately freeing it to handle new
connections.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">lingerd</tt> can do an effective job only if HTTP
<tt class="literal">KeepAlive</tt>s are turned off. Since
<tt class="literal">Keep-Alive</tt>s are useful for images, the recommended
setup is to serve dynamic content with mod_perl-enabled Apache and
<tt class="literal">lingerd</tt>, and static content with plain Apache.</p>

<p>With a <tt class="literal">lingerd</tt>setup, we don't
have the proxy (we don't want to use
<tt class="literal">lingerd</tt> on our <em class="emphasis">httpd_docs</em></tt>
server, which is also our proxy), so the buffering chain we presented
earlier for the proxy setup is much shorter here (see <a href="ch12_07.html#pmodperl-CHP-12-FIG-8">Figure 12-8</a>).</p>

<p>With <tt class="literal">lingerd</tt>, a big enough kernel send buffer, and

into a reduced load on the server. It can be used as an alternative

<h3 class="sect2">12.7.5. Caching Feature</h3>

<p>Apache <a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5021" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5022" />does
caching as well. It's relevant to mod_perl only if
you produce proper headers, so your scripts' output
can be cached. See the Apache documentation for more details on the
configuration of this capability.</p>

<p>To enable caching, use the <tt class="literal">CacheRoot</tt> directive,
specifying the directory where cache files are to be saved:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CacheRoot /usr/local/apache/cache</pre></blockquote>

<p>Make sure that directory is writable by the user under which
<em class="emphasis">httpd</em></tt> is running.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">CacheSize</tt> directive sets the desired space
usage in kilobytes:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CacheSize 50000   # 50 MB</pre></blockquote>

<p>Garbage collection, which enforces the cache size, is set in hours by
the <tt class="literal">CacheGcInterval</tt>. If unspecified, the cache
size will grow until disk space runs out. This setting tells
mod_proxy to check that your cache doesn't exceed
the maximum size every hour:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CacheGcInterval 1</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">CacheMaxExpire</tt>specifies the maximum number of
hours for which cached documents will be retained without checking
the origin server:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CacheMaxExpire 72</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the origin server for a document did not send an expiry date in
the form of an <tt class="literal">Expires</tt> header, then the
<tt class="literal">CacheLastModifiedFactor</tt> will be used to estimate
one by multiplying the factor by the time the document was last
modified, as supplied in the <tt class="literal">Last-Modified</tt> header.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">CacheLastModifiedFactor 0.1</pre></blockquote>

<p>If the content was modified 10 hours ago, mod_proxy will assume an
expiration time of 10 &#xD7; 0.1 = 1 hour. You should set this
according to how often your content is updated.</p>

<p>If neither <tt class="literal">Last-Modified</tt> nor
<tt class="literal">Expires</tt> is present, the
<tt class="literal">CacheDefaultExpire</tt> directive specifies the number
of hours until the document is expired from the cache:</p>

mod_proxy<a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5023" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-12-ITERM-5024" />
into Apache, just add <em class="emphasis">&#8212;enable-module=proxy</em></tt>
during the Apache <em class="emphasis">./configure</em></tt>stage. Since you
will probably need mod_rewrite's capability as well,
enable it with <em class="emphasis">&#8212;enable-module=rewrite</em></tt>.</p>
