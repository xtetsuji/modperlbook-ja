<h1 class="chapter">Colophon</h1><p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive
covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics,
breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.</p><p>The animal on the cover of <em class="citetitle">Practical
mod_perl</em> is a Thoroughbred horse. The Thoroughbred, also
called the English running horse, originated in England from
crossbreeding an Arabian horse and a Turkish horse to create the
fastest racing horse in the world. One of the swiftest of all
creatures and the fastest of horses, the Thoroughbred can maintain
speeds of up to 45 miles per hour for more than a mile. This makes the
Thoroughbred best-suited for racing, as well as for polo.</p><p>Thoroughbreds average 16 hands and 1,100 pounds in size. They
have a leggy appearance, complemented by a long, light neck. Their
heads are proportionate to their bodies, and their wide foreheads are
often adorned with white markings. In addition to their strong
physical characteristics, Thoroughbreds' personalities are noted for
their strength, courage, determination, and will. However, due to
their breeding, they also tend to be racy and nervous.</p><p>The integrity of the breed is closely maintained through stud
documentation. Since 1977, every foal registered in the American Stud
Book must be blood-typed to prove its origins.</p><p>Linley Dolby was the production editor, and Rachel Wheeler was
the copyeditor for <em class="citetitle">Practical mod_perl</em>. Sada
Preisch and Jane Ellin proofread the book, and Claire Cloutier
provided quality control. Tom Dinse wrote the index. Derek Di Matteo,
Matt Hutchinson, and Jamie Peppard provided production assistance.</p><p>Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a
series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is a 19th-century
engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. Emma Colby produced the
cover layout with QuarkXPress 4.1 using Adobe's ITC Garamond
font.</p><p>Bret Kerr designed the interior layout, based on a series design
by David Futato. This book was converted by Linda Mui and Andrew
Savikas to FrameMaker 5.5.6 with a format conversion tool created by
Erik Ray, Jason McIntosh, Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl
and XML technologies. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading
font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont's
TheSans Mono Condensed. The illustrations that appear in the book were
produced by Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read using Macromedia FreeHand
9 and Adobe Photoshop 6. This colophon was written by Linley
Dolby.</p><p>The online edition of this book was created by the Safari
production group (John Chodacki, Ellie Cutler, Becki Maisch, and Madeleine Newell)
using a set of Frame-to-XML conversion and cleanup tools written and
maintained by Erik Ray, Benn Salter, John Chodacki, and Jeff
Liggett.</p>
