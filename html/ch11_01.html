it's very important to go through the default
configuration file (<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>), because most of
the default settings were designed without mod_perl in mind. Some
variables (such as <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>) should be adapted
to the capabilities of your system, while some (such as
<tt class="literal">KeepAlive</tt>, in many cases) should be disabled,
because although they can improve performance for a plain Apache
server, they can reduce performance for a mod_perl server.</p><p>Correct configuration of the <tt class="literal">MinSpareServers</tt>,
<tt class="literal">MaxSpareServers</tt>, <tt class="literal">StartServers</tt>,
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>, and
<tt class="literal">MaxRequestsPerChild</tt> parameters is very important.
If they are too low, you will under-use the system's
capabilities. If they are too high, it is likely that the server will
bring the machine to its knees.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">KeepAlive</tt> directive improves the performance
of a plain Apache server by saving the TCP handshake if the client
requests more than one object from your server. But you
don't want this option to be enabled under mod_perl,
since it will keep a large mod_perl process tied to the client and do
nothing while waiting for the timeout to occur.</p><p>We will talk about these and other issues in the following sections.</p><div class="sect1"><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-SECT-1" />
<h2 class="sect1">11.1. Setting the MaxClients Directive</h2>

<p>It's important to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4870" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4871" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4872" />specify
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> on <a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4873" />the basis of the resources
your machine has. The <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> directive sets
the limit on the number of simultaneous
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4874" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4875" />requests that can be supported. No
more than this number of child server processes will be created. To
configure more than 256 clients, you must edit the
<tt class="literal">HARD_SERVER_LIMIT</tt> entry in
<em class="emphasis">httpd.h</em> and recompile Apache.</p>

<p>With a plain Apache server, it doesn't matter
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4876" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4877" />much if you run many child
processes&#8212;the processes are about 1 MB each (most of it
shared), so they don't eat a lot of RAM. The
situation is different with mod_perl, where the processes can easily
grow to 10 MB and more. For example, if you have
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>set to 50, the memory usage becomes 50
&#xD7; 10 MB = 500 MB.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-40">[40]</a> Do you have 500 MB of RAM
dedicated to the mod_perl server?</p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-40" /><p> [40]Of course, you also have
to take into account the shared memory usage, as described in <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10</a>.</p> </blockquote>

<p>With a high <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>, if you get a high load the
server will try to serve all requests immediately. Your CPU will have
a hard time keeping up, and if the child size multiplied by the
number of running children is larger than the total available RAM,
your server will start <a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4878" />swapping. The swapping will slow down
everything, which will lead to more swapping, slowing down everything
even more, until eventually the machine will die.
It's important that you take pains to ensure that
swapping does not normally happen. Swap space is an emergency pool,
not a resource to be used routinely. If you are low on memory and you
badly need it, buy it. Memory is cheap.</p>

<p>We want the value of <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> to be as small as
possible, because in this way we can limit the resources used by the
server's children. Since we can restrict each
child's process size, as discussed later, the
calculation of <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> is straightforward:</p>
<img src="figs/ch11eq2.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>So if we have 400 MB for the mod_perl server to use, we can set
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> to 40 if we know that each child is
limited to 10 MB of memory.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what will happen to your server if there are
more concurrent users than <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>. This
situation is pointed out by the following warning message in the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4879" />
file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[Sat May 18 13:40:35 2002] [error] server reached MaxClients setting,
consider raising the MaxClients setting</pre></blockquote>

<p>Technically there is no problem&#8212;any connection attempts over
the <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> limit will normally be queued, up
to a number based on the <tt class="literal">ListenBacklog</tt> directive.
When a child process is freed at the end of a different request, the
next waiting connection will be served.</p>

<p>But it is an error, because clients are being
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4880" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4881" />put in the queue rather than getting
served immediately, despite the fact that they do not get an error
response. The error can be allowed to persist to balance available
system resources and response time, but sooner or later you will need
to get more RAM so you can start more child processes. The best
approach is to prevent this situation from arising in the first
place, and if it keeps on happening you should start worrying about
it.</p>

<p>In <a href="ch10_01.html">Chapter 10</a> we showed that when
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4882" />memory sharing is available, the
approximate real memory used can be calculated by adding up all the
unshared memory of the client processes plus the memory of the parent
process, or, if the latter is unknown, the maximum shared memory size
of a single child process, which is smaller than the memory size of
the parent process but good enough for our calculations. We have also
devised the following formula:</p>
<img src="figs/ch11eq3.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>where <tt class="literal">Total_RAM</tt> is of course the estimated total
RAM available to the web server.</p>

<p>Let's perform some calculations, first with sharing
in place:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Total_RAM                = 500Mb
Max_Process_Size         =  10Mb
Min_Shared_RAM_per_Child =   4Mb</pre></blockquote>
<img src="figs/ch11eq4.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>then with no sharing in place:</p>
<img src="figs/ch11eq5.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>With sharing in place, if your numbers are similar to the ones in our
example, you can have 64% more servers without buying more RAM (82
compared to 50).</p>

<p>If you improve sharing and the sharing level is maintained throughout
the child's life, you might get:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Total_RAM            = 500Mb
Max_Process_Size     =  10Mb
Shared_RAM_per_Child =   8Mb</pre></blockquote>
<img src="figs/ch11eq6.gif" alt="Figure " />
<p>Here we have 392% more servers (246 compared to 50)!</p>

<p>There is one more nuance to remember. The number of requests per
second that your server can serve won't grow
linearly when you raise the value of <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>.
Assuming that you have a lot of RAM available and you try to set
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> as high as possible, you will find that
you eventually reach a point where increasing the
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> value will not improve performance.</p>

<p>The more clients that are running, the more CPU time will be required
and the fewer CPU time slices each process will receive. The response
latency (the time to respond to a request) will grow, so you
won't see the expected improvement.
Let's explore these issues.</p>

<p>The test handler that we have used is shown in <a href="ch11_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-11-EX-1">Example 11-1</a>. You can see that it does mostly CPU-intensive
computations.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 11-1. Book/HandlerBenchmark.pm</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">package Book::HandlerBenchmark;
use Apache::Constants qw(:common);
sub handler {
    $r = shift;
    $r-&gt;send_http_header('text/html');
    $r-&gt;print("Hello");
    my $x = 100;
    my $y = log ($x ** 100) for (0..100);
    return OK;
}
1;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Here's the configuration section to enable this
handler:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlModule Book::HandlerBenchmark
&lt;Location /benchmark_handler_middle&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Book::HandlerBenchmark
&lt;/Location&gt;</pre></blockquote>

<p>Now we will run the benchmark for different values of
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>. The results are:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">MaxClients  | avtime completed failed    rps
--------------------------------------------
       100  |    333     50000      0    755
       125  |    340     50000      0    780
       150  |    342     50000      0    791
       175  |    338     50000      0    783
       200  |    339     50000      0    785
       225  |    365     50000      0    760
       250  |    402     50000      0    741
---------------------------------------------

Non-varying sub-test parameters:
---------------------------------------------
MaxRequestsPerChild : 0
StartServers        : 100
Concurrency         : 300
Number of requests  : 50000
---------------------------------------------</pre></blockquote>

<p><a href="ch11_01.html#pmodperl-CHP-11-FIG-1">Figure 11-1</a> depicts requests per second versus
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt>. Looking at this figure, you can see
that with a concurrency level of 300, the performance is almost
identical for <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> values of 150 and 200,
but it goes down for the value of 100 (not enough processes) and are
even worse for the value of 250 (too many processes competing over
CPU cycles). Note that we have kept the server fully loaded, since
the number of concurrent requests was always higher than the number
of available processes, which means that some requests were queued
rather than responded to immediately. When the number of processes
went above 200, more and more time was spent by the processes in the
sleep state and context switching, enlarging the latency of response
generation. On the other hand, with only 100 available processes, the
CPU was not fully loaded and we had plenty of memory available. You
can see that in our case, a <tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> value of
150 is close to optimal.<a href="#FOOTNOTE-41">[41]</a></p> <blockquote><a name="FOOTNOTE-41" /><p> [41]When we tried the same
benchmark on different machines with a much stronger CPU and more
memory, we saw different results. So we would like to stress again
that the optimal configuration choices for a given application and
load pattern may vary from machine to machine.</p> </blockquote>

<p>This leads us to an interesting discovery, which we can summarize in
the following way: increasing your RAM might not improve the
performance if
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4883" />your CPU is already fully loaded with the
current number of processes. In fact, if you start more processes,
you will get a degradation in performance. On the other hand, if you
decide to upgrade your machine with a very powerful CPU but you
don't add enough memory, the machine will use swap
memory or the CPU will be under-used; in any case, the performance
will be poor. Whenever you opt for a more powerful CPU, you must
always budget for enough extra memory to ensure that the
CPU's greater processing power is fully utilized. It
is generally best to add more memory in the first place to see if
that helps with performance problems (assuming you follow our tuning
advice as well).</p>

<p>To discover the right configuration for your server, you should run
benchmarks on a machine with identical hardware to the one that you
are going to use in production. Try to simulate the probable loads
your machine will experience. Remember that the load will be
variable, and plan accordingly. Experiment with the configuration
parameters under different loads to discover the optimal balance of
CPU and RAM use for your machine. When you change the processor or
add RAM, retest the configuration to see how to change the settings
to get the best from the new hardware.</p>

<p>You can tune your machine using reports like the one in our example,
by analyzing either the requests per second
(<em class="emphasis">rps</em>) column, which shows the throughput of your
server, or the average processing time (<em class="emphasis">avtime</em>)
column, which can be seen as the latency of your server. Take more
samples to build nicer linear graphs, and pick the value of
<tt class="literal">MaxClients</tt> where the curve reaches a maximum value
for a throughput graph or reaches the minimum value for a<a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4884" /> latency <a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4885" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4886" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-11-ITERM-4887" />graph.</p>
