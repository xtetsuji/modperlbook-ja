<h2 class="sect1">14.2. Coding for a Smaller Memory Footprint</h2>

<p>The following sections present proactive techniques that prevent
processes from growing large in the first place.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.1. Memory Reuse</h3>

<p>Consider the code in<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5198" /> <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-1">Example 14-1</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 14-1. memory_hog.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use GTop ( );
my $gtop = GTop-&gt;new;
my $proc = $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$);
print "size before:  ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
{
    my $x = 'a' x 10**7;
    print "size inside: ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
}
print "size  after: ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>When executed, it prints:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">size before:  1830912 B
size inside: 21852160 B
size  after: 21852160 B</pre></blockquote>

<p>This script starts by printing the size of the memory it occupied
when it was first loaded. The opening curly brace starts a new block,
in which <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5199" />a
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5200" />lexical
variable <tt class="literal">$x</tt> is populated with a string 10,000,000
bytes in length. The script then prints the new size of the process
and exits from the block. Finally, the script again prints the size
of the process.</p>

<p>Since the variable <tt class="literal">$x</tt> is lexical, it is destroyed
at the end of the block, before the final print statement, thus
releasing all the memory that it was occupying. But from the output
we can clearly see that a huge chunk of memory
wasn't released to the OS&#8212;the
process's memory usage didn't
change. Perl reuses this released memory internally. For example,
let's modify the script as shown in <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-2">Example 14-2</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-2" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 14-2. memory_hog2.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use GTop ( );
my $gtop = GTop-&gt;new;
my $proc = $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$);
print "size before :  ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
{
    my $x = 'a' x 10**7;
    print "size inside : ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
}
print "size  after : ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
{
    my $x = 'a' x 10;
    print "size inside2: ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";
}
print "size  after2: ", $gtop-&gt;proc_mem($$)-&gt;size( ), " B\n";</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>When we execute this script, we will see the following output:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">size before :  1835008 B
size inside : 21852160 B
size  after : 21852160 B
size inside2: 21852160 B
size  after2: 21852160 B</pre></blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the memory usage of this script was no more than that
of the previous one.</p>

<p>So we have just learned that Perl programs don't
return memory to the OS until they quit. If variables go out of
scope, the memory they occupied is reused by Perl for newly created
or growing variables.</p>

<p>Suppose your code does memory-intensive operations and the processes
grow fast at first, but after a few requests the sizes of the
processes stabilize as Perl starts to reuse the acquired memory. In
this case, the wisest approach is to find this limiting size and set
the upper memory limit to a slightly higher value. If you set the
limit lower, processes will be killed <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5201" />unnecessarily and lots of redundant
operations will be performed by the OS.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.2. Big Input, Big Damage</h3>

<p>This section demonstrates how a<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5202" />
malicious <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5203" />user <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5204" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5205" />can bring the service down or cause
problems by submitting unexpectedly big data.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have a guestbook script/handler, which works fine.
But you've forgotten about a small nuance: you
don't check the size of the submitted message. A 10
MB core file copied and pasted into the HTML
<tt class="literal">textarea</tt> entry box intended for a
guest's message and submitted to the server will
make the server grow by at least 10 MB. (Not to mention the horrible
experience users will go through when trying to view the guest book,
since the contents of the binary core file will be displayed.) If
your server is short of memory, after a few more submissions like
this one it will start swapping, and it may be on its way to crashing
once all the swap memory is exhausted.</p>

<p>To prevent such a thing from happening, you could check the size of
the submitted argument, like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $r = shift;
my %args = $r-&gt;args;
my $message = exists $args{message} ? $args{message} : '';
die "the message is too big" 
    unless length $message &gt; 8192; # 8KB</pre></blockquote>

<p>While this prevents your program from adding huge inputs into the
guest book, the size of the process will grow anyway, since you have
allowed the code to process the submitted form's
data. The only way to really protect your server from accepting huge
inputs is not to read data above some preset limit. However, you
cannot safely rely on the <tt class="literal">Content-Length</tt> header,
since that can easily be spoofed.</p>

<p>You don't have to worry about <tt class="literal">GET</tt>
requests, since their data is submitted via the query string of the
URI, which has a hard limit of about 8 KB.</p>

<p>Think about disabling file uploads if you don't use
them. Remember that a user can always write an HTML form from scratch
and submit it to your program for processing, which makes it easy to
submit huge files. If you don't limit the size of
the form input, even if your program rejects the faulty input, the
data will be read in by the server and the process will grow as a
result. Here is a simple example that will readily accept anything
submitted by the form, including fields that you
didn't create, which a malicious user may have added
by mangling the original form:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI;
my $q = CGI-&gt;new;
my %args = map {$_ =&gt; $q-&gt;param($_)} $q-&gt;params;</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using <tt class="literal">CGI.pm</tt>, you can set the maximum
allowed <tt class="literal">POST</tt>size and disable file uploads using
the following setting:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">use CGI;
$CGI::POST_MAX = 1048576;  # max 1MB allowed
$CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS = 1; # disable file uploads</pre></blockquote>

<p>The above setting will reject all submitted forms whose total size
exceeds 1 MB. Only non-file upload inputs will be processed.</p>

<p>If you are using the <tt class="literal">Apache::Request</tt> module, you
can disable file uploads and limit the maximum
<tt class="literal">POST</tt>size by passing the appropriate arguments to
the <tt class="literal">new( )</tt> function. The following example has the
same effect as the <tt class="literal">CGI.pm</tt> example shown above:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $apr = Apache::Request-&gt;new($r, 
                               POST_MAX        =&gt; 1048576,
                               DISABLE_UPLOADS =&gt; 1
                              );</pre></blockquote>

<p>Another alternative is to use the <tt class="literal">LimitRequestBody</tt>
directive in <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> to limit the size of the
request body. This directive can be set per-server, per-directory,
per-file, or per-location. The default value is 0, which means
unlimited. As an example, to limit the size of the request body to 2
MB, you should add:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">LimitRequestBody 2097152</pre></blockquote>

<p>The value is set in bytes (2097152 bytes =  = 2 MB).</p>

<p>In this section, we have presented only a single example among many
that can cause your server to use more memory than planned. It helps
to keep an open mind and to explore what other things a creative user
might try to do with your service. Don't assume
users will only click where you <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5206" />intend <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5207" />them to.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.3. Small Input, Big Damage</h3>

<p>This section demonstrates how a <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5208" />small input <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5209" />submitted by a malicious user
may hog the whole server.</p>

<p>Imagine an online service that allows users to create a canvas on the
server side and do some fancy image processing. Among the inputs that
are to be submitted by the user are the width and the height of the
canvas. If the program doesn't restrict the maximum
values for them, some smart user may ask your program to create a
canvas of 1,000,000 &#xD7; 1,000,000 pixels. In addition to
working the CPU rather heavily, the processes that serve this request
will probably eat all the available memory (including the swap space)
and kill the server.</p>

<p>How can the user do this, if you have prepared a form with a
pull-down list of possible choices? Simply by saving the form and
later editing it, or by using a <tt class="literal">GET</tt> request.
Don't forget that what you receive is merely an
input from a user agent, and it can very easily be spoofed by anyone
knowing <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5210" />how to use <tt class="literal">LWP::UserAgent</tt>
or something equivalent. There are various techniques to prevent
users from fiddling with forms, but it's much
simpler to make your code check that the submitted values are
acceptable and then move on.</p>

<p>If you do some relational database processing, you will often
encounter the need to read lots of records from the database and then
print them to the browser after they are formatted.
Let's look at an example.</p>

<p>We will use <tt class="literal">DBI</tt> and <tt class="literal">CGI.pm</tt> for
this example. Assume that we are already connected to the database
server (refer to the <tt class="literal">DBI</tt> manpage for a complete
reference to the <tt class="literal">DBI</tt> module):</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $q = new CGI;
my $default_hits = 10;
my $hits = int $q-&gt;param("hints") || $default_hits;

my $do_sql = "SELECT from foo LIMIT 0,$hits";
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($do_sql);
$sth-&gt;execute;

while (@row_ary = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array) {
    # do DB accumulation into some variable
}
# print the data
...</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example, the records are accumulated in the program data
before they are printed. The variables that are used to store the
records that matched the query will grow by the size of the data, in
turn causing the <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> process to grow by the
same amount.</p>

<p>Imagine a search engine interface that allows a user to choose to
display 10, 50, or 100 results. What happens if the user modifies the
form to ask for 1,000,000 hits? If you have a big enough database,
and if you rely on the fact that the only valid choices would be 10,
50, or 100 without actually checking, your database engine may
unexpectedly return a million records. Your process will grow by many
megabytes, possibly eating all the available memory and swap space.</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to disallow arbitrary inputs for critical
variables like this one. Another improvement is to avoid the
accumulation of matched records in the program data. Instead, you
could use <tt class="literal">DBI::bind_columns( )</tt> or a similar
function to print each record as it is fetched from <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5211" />the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5212" />database. In <a href="ch20_01.html">Chapter 20</a> we <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5213" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5214" />will talk about this technique in
depth.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.4. Think Production, Not Development</h3>

<p>Developers often use <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5215" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5216" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5217" />sample inputs for testing their new code.
But sometimes they forget that the real inputs can be much bigger
than those they used in development.</p>

<p>Consider code like this, which is common enough in Perl scripts:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">{
    open IN, $file or die $!;
    local $/;
    $content = &lt;IN&gt;; # slurp the whole file in
    close IN;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you know for sure that the input will always be small, the code we
have presented here might be fine. But if the file is 5 MB, the child
process that executes this script when serving the request will grow
by that amount. Now if you have 20 children, and each one executes
this code, together they will consume 20 &#xD7; 5 MB = 100 MB
of RAM! If, when the code was developed and tested, the input file
was very small, this potential excessive memory usage probably went
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Try to think about the many situations in which your code might be
used. For example, it's possible that the input will
originate from a source you did not envisage. Your code might behave
badly as a result. To protect against this possibility, you might
want to try to use other approaches to processing the file. If it has
lines, perhaps you can process one line at a time instead of reading
them all into a variable at once. If you need to modify the file, use
a temporary file. When the processing is finished, you can overwrite
the source file. Make sure that you lock the files when you modify
them.</p>

<p>Often you just don't expect the input to grow. For
example, you may want to write a birthday reminder process intended
for your own personal use. If you have 100 friends and relatives
about whom you want to be reminded, slurping the whole file in before
processing it might be a perfectly reasonable way to approach the
task.</p>

<p>But what happens if your friends (who know you as one who usually
forgets their birthdays) are so surprised by your timely birthday
greetings that they ask you to allow them to use your cool invention
as well? If all 100 friends have yet another 100 friends, you could
end up with 10,000 records in your database. The code may not work
well with input of this size. Certainly, the answer is to rewrite the
code to use a DBM file or a relational database. If you continue to
store the records in a flat file and read the whole database into
memory, your code will use a lot of <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5218" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5219" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5220" />memory and be very slow.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.5. Passing Variables</h3>

<p>Let's talk about passing <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5221" />varia<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5222" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5223" />bles to a subroutine. There are
two ways to do this: you can pass a <em class="emphasis">copy</em> of the
variable to the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5224" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5225" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5226" />subroutine (this is called
<em class="emphasis">passing by value</em>) or you can instead pass a
<em class="emphasis">reference</em> to it (a reference is just a pointer,
so the variable itself is not copied). Other things being equal, if
the copy of the variable is larger than a pointer to it, it will be
more efficient to pass a reference.</p>

<p>Let's use the example from the previous section,
assuming we have no choice but to read the whole file before any data
processing takes place and its size is 5 MB. Suppose you have some
subroutine called <tt class="literal">process( )</tt> that processes the
data and returns it. Now say you pass <tt class="literal">$content</tt> by
value and <tt class="literal">process( )</tt> makes a copy of it in the
familiar way:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $content = qq{foobarfoobar};
$content = process($content);
sub process {
    my $content = shift;
    $content =~ s/foo/bar/gs;
    return $content;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>You have just copied another 5 MB, and the child has grown in size by
another 5 MB. Assuming 20 Apache children, you can multiply this
growth again by factor of 20&#8212;now you have 200 MB of wasted RAM!
This will eventually be reused, but it's still a
waste. Whenever you think the variable may grow bigger than a few
kilobytes, definitely pass it by reference.</p>

<p>There are several forms of syntax you can use to pass and use
variables passed by reference. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $content = qq{foobarfoobar};
process(\$content);
sub process {
    my $r_content = shift; 
    $$r_content =~ s/foo/bar/gs;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>Here <tt class="literal">$content</tt> is populated with some data and then
passed by reference to the subroutine <tt class="literal">process( )</tt>,
which replaces all occurrences of the string <em class="emphasis">foo</em>
with the string <em class="emphasis">bar</em>. <tt class="literal">process(
)</tt> doesn't have to return
anything&#8212;the variable <tt class="literal">$content</tt> was modified
directly, since <tt class="literal">process( )</tt> took a reference to it.</p>

<p>If the hashes or arrays are passed by reference, their individual
elements are still accessible. You don't need to
dereference them:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$var_lr-&gt;[$index]  get $index'th element of an array via a ref
$var_hr-&gt;{$key}    get $key'th element of a hash via a ref</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that if you pass the variable by reference but then dereference
it to copy it to a new string, you don't gain
anything, since a new chunk of memory will be acquired to make a
<em class="emphasis">copy</em> of the original variable. The
<em class="emphasis">perlref</em> manpage provides extensive information
about
working<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5227" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5228" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5229" /> with references.</p>

<p>Another approach is to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5230" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5231" />use
the <tt class="literal">@_</tt> array directly. Internally, Perl always
passes these variables by reference and dereferences them when they
are copied from the <tt class="literal">@_</tt> array. This is an
efficiency mechanism to allow you to write subroutines that take a
variable passed as a value, without copying it.</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">process($content);
sub process {
  $_[0] =~ s/foo/bar/gs;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>From <em class="emphasis">perldoc perlsub</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">The array @_ is a local array, but its elements are aliases for the actual scalar 
parameters.  In particular, if an element $_[0] is updated, the corresponding 
argument is updated (or an error occurs if it is not possible to update)...</pre></blockquote>

<p>Be careful when you write this kind of subroutine for use by someone
else; it can be confusing. It's not obvious that a
call like <tt class="literal">process($content);</tt> modifies the passed
variable. Programmers (the users of your library, in this case) are
used to subroutines that either modify variables passed by reference
or expressly return a result, like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$content = process($content);</pre></blockquote>

<p>You should also be aware that if the user tries to submit a read-only
value, this code won't work and you will get a
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5232" />runtime
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5233" />error.
Perl will <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5234" />refuse to modify a read-only value:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$content = process("string foo");</pre></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-SECT-2.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">14.2.6. Memory Leakage</h3>

<p>It's normal for a process to <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5235" />grow
when it processes its first few requests. They may be different
requests, or the same requests processing different data. You may try
to reload the same request a few times, and in many cases the process
will stop growing after only the second reload. In any case, once a
representative selection of requests and inputs has been executed by
a process, it won't usually grow any more unless the
code leaks memory. If it grows after each reload of an identical
request, there is probably a memory leak.</p>

<p>The experience might be different if the code works with some
external resource that can change between requests. For example, if
the code retrieves database records matching some query,
it's possible that from time to time the database
will be updated and that a different number of records will match the
same query the next time it is issued. Depending on the techniques
you use to retrieve the data, format it, and send it to the user, the
process may increase or decrease in size, reflecting the changes in
the data.</p>

<p>The easiest way to see whether the code is leaking is to run the
server in single-process mode (<em class="emphasis">httpd -X</em>),
issuing the same request a few times to see whether the process grows
after each request. If it does, you probably have a memory leak. If
the code leaks 5 KB per request, then after 1,000 requests to run the
leaking code, 5 MB of memory will have leaked. If in production you
have 20 processes, this could possibly lead to 100 MB of leakage
after a few tens of thousands of requests.</p>

<p>This technique to detect leakage can be misleading if you are not
careful. Suppose your process first runs some clean (non-leaking)
code that acquires 100 KB of memory. In an attempt to make itself
more efficient, Perl doesn't give the 100 KB of
memory back to the operating system. The next time the process runs
<em class="emphasis">any</em> script, some of the 100 KB will be reused.
But if this time the process runs a script that needs to acquire only
5 KB, you won't see the process grow even if the
code has actually leaked these 5 KB. Now it might take 20 or more
requests for the leaking script <em class="emphasis">served by the same
process</em> before you would see that process start growing
again.</p>

<p>A process may leak memory <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5236" />for several reasons: badly
written system C/C++ libraries used in the <em class="emphasis">httpd</em>
binary and badly written Perl code are the most common. Perl modules
may also use C libraries, and these might leak memory as well. Also,
some operating systems have been known to have problems with their
memory-management functions.</p>

<p>If you know that you have no leaks in your code, then for detecting
leaks in C/C++ libraries you should either use the technique of
sampling the memory usage described above, or use C/C++ developer
tools designed for this purpose. This topic is beyond the scope of
this book.</p>

<p>The <tt class="literal">Apache::Leak</tt>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5237" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5238" />module
(derived from <tt class="literal">Devel::Leak</tt>) might help you to
detect leaks in your code. Consider the script in <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-3">Example 14-3</a>.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-3" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 14-3. leaktest.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">use Apache::Leak;

my $global = "FooA";

leak_test {
    $$global = 1;
    ++$global;
};</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>You do not need to be inside mod_perl to use this script. The
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5239" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5240" />argument to <tt class="literal">leak_test( )</tt>
is an anonymous sub or a block, so you can just throw in any code you
suspect might be leaking. The script will run the code twice. The
first time, new scalar values (SVs) are created, but this does not
mean the code is leaking. The second pass will give better evidence.</p>

<p>From the command line, the above script outputs:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">ENTER: 1482 SVs
new c28b8 : new c2918 : 
LEAVE: 1484 SVs
ENTER: 1484 SVs
new db690 : new db6a8 : 
LEAVE: 1486 SVs
!!! 2 SVs leaked !!!</pre></blockquote>

<p>This module uses the <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5241" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5242" />simple approach of walking the
Perl internal table of allocated SVs. It records them before entering
the scope of the code under test and after leaving the scope. At the
end, a comparison of the two sets is <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5243" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5244" />performed, <tt class="literal">sv_dump( )</tt> is
called for anything that did not exist in the first set, and the
difference in counts is reported. Note that you will see the dumps of
SVs only if Perl was built with the <em class="emphasis">-DDEBUGGING</em>
option. In our example the script will dump two SVs twice, since the
same code is run twice. The volume of output is too great to be
presented here.</p>

<p>Our example leaks because <tt class="literal">$$global = 1;</tt> creates a
new global variable, <tt class="literal">FooA</tt> (with the value of
<tt class="literal">1</tt>), which will not be destroyed until this module
is destroyed. Under mod_perl the module doesn't get
destroyed until the process quits. When the code is run the second
time, <tt class="literal">$global</tt> will contain <tt class="literal">FooB</tt>
because of the increment operation at the end of the first run.
Consider:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">$foo = "AAA";
print "$foo\n";
$foo++;
print "$foo\n";</pre></blockquote>

<p>which prints:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">AAA
AAB</pre></blockquote>

<p>So every time the code is executed, a new variable
(<tt class="literal">FooC</tt>, <tt class="literal">FooD</tt>, etc.) will spring
into existence.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">Apache::Leak</tt> is not very user-friendly. You may
want to take a look at <tt class="literal">B::LexInfo</tt>. It is possible
to see something that might appear to be a leak, but is actually just
a Perl optimization. Consider this code, for example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">sub test { my ($string) = @_;}
test("a string");</pre></blockquote>

<p><tt class="literal">B::LexInfo</tt> will show you that Perl does not
release the value from <tt class="literal">$string</tt> unless you
<tt class="literal">undef( )</tt> it. This is because Perl anticipates that
the memory will be needed for another string, the next time the
subroutine is entered. You'll see similar behavior
for <tt class="literal">@array</tt> lengths, <tt class="literal">%hash</tt> keys,
and scratch areas <a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5245" />of the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-14-ITERM-5246" />padlist
for operations such as <tt class="literal">join( )</tt>,
., etc.</p>

<p>Let's look at how <tt class="literal">B::LexInfo</tt>
works. The code in <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-4">Example 14-4</a> creates a new
<tt class="literal">B::LexInfo</tt> object, then runs <tt class="literal">cvrundiff(
)</tt>, which creates two snapshots of the lexical
variables' padlists&#8212;one before the call to
<tt class="literal">LeakTest1::test( )</tt> and the other, in this case,
after it has been called with the argument "<tt class="literal">a
string</tt>". Then it calls <em class="emphasis">diff -u</em> to
generate the difference between the snapshots.</p>

<h4 class="objtitle">Example 14-4. leaktest1.pl</h4>

my $lexi = B::LexInfo-&gt;new;
my $diff = $lexi-&gt;cvrundiff('LeakTest1::test', "a string");
print $$diff;</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>In case you aren't familiar with how
<tt class="literal">diff</tt> works, <tt class="literal">-</tt> at the beginning
of the line means that that line was removed, <tt class="literal">+</tt>
means that a line was added, and other lines are there to show the
context in which the difference was found. Here is the output:</p>

<p>Perl tries to optimize the speed by keeping the memory allocated for

<p>Let's run the script from <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-3">Example 14-3</a> with <tt class="literal">B::LexInfo</tt> (see <a href="ch14_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-14-EX-5">Example 14-5</a>).</p>

<p>We can clearly see the leakage, since the value of the
<tt class="literal">PV</tt> entry has changed from one string to a
different one. Compare this with the previous example, where a
variable didn't exist and sprang into existence for
optimization reasons. If you find this confusing, probably the best
approach is to run <em class="emphasis">diff</em> twice when you test your
code.</p>
