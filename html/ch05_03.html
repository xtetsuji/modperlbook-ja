<h2 class="sect1">5.3. Using kill to Control Processes</h2>

<p>Linux and <a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4024" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4025" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4026" />other Unix-like operating systems
support a form of interprocess communication called
<em class="emphasis">signals</em>. The <em class="emphasis">kill</em> command
is used to send a signal to a running process. How a process responds
to a signal, if it responds at all, depends on the specific signal
sent and on the handler set by the process. If you are familiar with
Unix signal handling, you will find that Apache adheres to the usual
conventions, and you can probably skip this section. This section
describes the use of <em class="emphasis">kill</em> in relation to Apache
for readers who aren't accustomed to working with
signals.</p>

<p>The name "kill" is a misnomer; it
sounds as if the command is inherently destructive, but
<em class="emphasis">kill</em> simply sends signals to programs. Only a
few signals will actually kill the process by default. Most signals
can be caught by the process, which may choose to either perform a
specific action or ignore the signal. When a process is in a zombie
or uninterruptible <tt class="literal">sleep( )</tt>state, it might ignore
any signals.</p>

<p>The following example will help dispel any fear of using this
command. Most people who are familiar with the command line know that
pressing Ctrl-C will usually terminate a process running in a
console. For example, it is common to execute:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% tail -f /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</pre></blockquote>

<p>to monitor the Apache server's
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file. The only way to stop
<em class="emphasis">tail</em> is by pressing Ctrl-C in the console in
which the process is running. The same result can be achieved by
sending the INT (interrupt) signal to this process. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% kill -INT 17084</pre></blockquote>

<p>When this command is run, the <em class="emphasis">tail</em> process is
aborted, assuming that the process identifier (PID) of the
<em class="emphasis">tail</em> process is 17084.</p>

<p>Every process running in the system has its own PID.
<em class="emphasis">kill</em> identifies processes by their PIDs. If
<em class="emphasis">kill</em> were to use process names and there were
two <em class="emphasis">tail</em> processes running, it might send the
signal to the wrong process. The most common way to determine the
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4027" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4028" />PID of a process is to use
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4029" /><em class="emphasis">ps</em> to display
information about the current processes on the machine. The arguments
to this utility vary depending on the operating system. For example,
on BSD-family systems, the following command works:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% ps auxc | grep tail</pre></blockquote>

<p>On a System V Unix flavor such as Solaris, the following command may
be used instead:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% ps -eaf | grep tail</pre></blockquote>

<p>In the first part of the command, <em class="emphasis">ps</em> prints
information about all the current processes. This is then piped to a
<em class="emphasis">grep</em> command that prints lines containing the
text "tail". Assuming only one such
<em class="emphasis">tail</em> process is running, we get the following
output:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">root  17084  0.1  0.1  1112  408  pts/8  S  17:28  0:00  tail</pre></blockquote>

<p>The first column shows the username of the account running the
process, the second column shows the PID, and the last column shows
the name of the command. The other columns vary between operating
systems.</p>

<p>Processes are free to ignore almost all signals they receive, and
there are cases when they will. Let's run the
<em class="emphasis">less</em> command on the same
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% less /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/error_log</pre></blockquote>

<p>Neither pressing Ctrl-C nor sending the INT signal will kill the
process, because the implementers of this utility chose to ignore
that signal. The way to kill the process is to type
<em class="emphasis">q</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes numerical signal values are used instead of their symbolic
names. For example, 2 is normally the numeric equivalent of the
symbolic name INT. Hence, these two commands are equivalent on Linux:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% kill -2 17084
panic% kill -INT 17084</pre></blockquote>

<p>On Solaris, the <em class="emphasis">-s</em> option is used when working
with symbolic signal names:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% kill -s INT 17084</pre></blockquote>

<p>To find the numerical equivalents, either refer to the
<em class="emphasis">signal(7)</em> manpage, or ask Perl to help you:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% perl -MConfig -e 'printf "%6s %2d\n", $_, $sig++ \
                    for split / /, $Config{sig_name}'</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you want to send a signal to all processes with the same name, you
can use <em class="emphasis">pkill</em> on Solaris or
<em class="emphasis">killall</em> on Linux.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-SECT-3.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.1. kill Signals for Stopping and Restarting Apache</h3>

<p>Apache <a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4030" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4031" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4032" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4033" />performs
certain actions in response to the KILL, TERM, HUP, and USR1 signals
(as arguments to <em class="emphasis">kill</em>). All Apache system
administrators should be familiar with the use of these signals to
control the Apache web server.</p>

<p>By referring to the
<em class="emphasis">signal.h</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4034" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4035" /> file, we learn the numerical
equivalents of these signals:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">#define SIGHUP     1    /* hangup, generated when terminal disconnects */
#define SIGKILL    9    /* last resort */
#define SIGTERM   15    /* software termination signal */
#define SIGUSR1   30    /* user defined signal 1 */</pre></blockquote>

<p>The four types of signal are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><i>KILL signal: forcefully shutdown</i></dt>
<dd>
The KILL (9) signal <a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4036" />should <em class="emphasis">never</em></tt> be used
unless absolutely necessary, because it will unconditionally kill
Apache, without allowing it to clean up properly. For example, the
<em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em></tt> file will not be deleted, and any
existing requests will simply be terminated halfway through. Although
failure to delete <em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em></tt> is harmless, if code
was registered to run upon child exit but was not executed because
Apache was sent the KILL signal, you may have problems. For example,
a database connection may be closed incorrectly, leaving the database
in an inconsistent state.</p>

<p>The three other signals have safe and legitimate uses, and the next
sections will explain what happens when each of them is sent to an
Apache server process.</p>

<p>It should be noted that these signals should be sent only to the
<em class="emphasis">parent</em></tt> process, not to any of the child
processes. The parent process PID may be found either by using
<em class="emphasis">ps auxc | grep apache</em></tt> (where it will usually be
the lowest-numbered Apache process) or by executing
<em class="emphasis">cat</em></tt> on the <em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em></tt> file.
See <a href="ch05_03.html#pmodperl-CHP-5-SECT-3.3">Section 5.3.3</a>, later in this
chapter, for more information.</p>

</dd>


<dt><i>TERM signal: stop now</i></dt>
<dd>
Sending<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4037" /> the TERM
signal to the parent causes it to attempt to kill off all its
children immediately. Any requests in progress are terminated, and no
further requests are accepted. This operation may take tens of
seconds to complete. To stop a child, the parent sends it an HUP
signal. If the child does not die before a predetermined amount of
time, the parent sends a second HUP signal. If the child fails to
respond to the second HUP, the parent then sends a TERM signal, and
if the child still does not die, the parent sends the KILL signal as
a last resort. Each failed attempt to kill a child generates an entry
in the <em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file.</p>

<p>Before each process is terminated, the Perl cleanup stage happens, in
which Perl <tt class="literal">END</tt> blocks and global
objects' <tt class="literal">DESTROY</tt> methods are run.</p>

<p>When all child processes have been terminated, all open log files are
closed and the parent itself exits.</p>

<p>Unless an explicit signal name is provided, <em class="emphasis">kill</em>
sends the TERM signal by default. Therefore:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic# kill -TERM 1640</pre></blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic# kill 1640</pre></blockquote>

<p>will do the same thing.</p>

</dd>


<dt><i>HUP signal: restart now</i></dt>
<dd>
Sending the<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4038" /> HUP
signal to the parent causes it to kill off its children as if the
TERM signal had been sent. That is, any requests in progress are
terminated, but the parent does not exit. Instead, the parent rereads
its configuration files, spawns a new set of child processes, and
continues to serve requests. It is almost equivalent to stopping and
then restarting the server.</p>

<p>If the configuration files contain errors when restart is signaled,
the parent will exit, so it is important to check the configuration
files for errors before issuing a restart. We'll
cover how to check for errors shortly.</p>

<p>Using this approach to restart mod_perl-enabled Apache may cause the
processes' memory consumption to grow after each
restart. This happens when Perl code loaded in memory is not
completely torn down, leading to a memory leak.</p>

</dd>


<dt><i>USR1 signal: gracefully restart now</i></dt>
<dd>
The USR1<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4039" /> signal
causes the parent process to advise the children to exit after
serving their current requests, or to exit immediately if they are
not serving a request. The parent rereads its configuration files and
reopens its log files. As each child dies off, the parent replaces it
with a child from the new generation (the new children use the new
configuration) and the new child processes begin serving new requests
immediately.</p>

<p>The only difference between USR1 and HUP is that USR1 allows the
children to complete any current requests prior to terminating. There
is no interruption in the service, unlike with the HUP signal, where
service is interrupted for the few (and sometimes more) seconds it
takes for a restart to complete.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<p>By default, if a server is restarted using the USR1 or the HUP signal
and mod_perl is not compiled as a DSO, Perl scripts and modules are
not reloaded. To reload modules pulled in via
<tt class="literal">PerlRequire</tt>, <tt class="literal">PerlModule</tt>, or
<tt class="literal">use</tt>, and to flush the
<tt class="literal">Apache::Registry</tt> cache, either completely stop the
server and then start it again, or use this directive in
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlFreshRestart On</pre></blockquote>

<p>(This directive is not always recommended. See <a href="ch22_01.html">Chapter 22</a> for further <a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4040" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4041" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4042" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4043" />details.)</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-SECT-3.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">5.3.2. Speeding Up Apache's Termination and Restart</h3>

<p>Restart or
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4044" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4045" />termination
of a mod_perl server may sometimes take quite a long time, perhaps
even tens of seconds. The reason for this is a call to the
<tt class="literal">perl_destruct( )</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4046" /> function during the child exit
phase, which is also known as the cleanup phase. In this phase, the
Perl <tt class="literal">END</tt> blocks are run and the
<tt class="literal">DESTROY</tt><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4047" /> method is called on any global objects
that are still around.</p>

<p>Sometimes this will produce a series of messages in the
<em class="emphasis">error_log</em> file, warning that certain child
processes did not exit as expected. This happens when a child
process, after a few attempts have been made to terminate it, is
still in the middle of <tt class="literal">perl_destruct( )</tt>. So when
you shut down the server, you might see something like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">[warn]   child process 7269 still did not exit,
         sending a SIGTERM
[error]  child process 7269 still did not exit,
         sending a SIGKILL
[notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down</pre></blockquote>

<p>First, the parent process sends the TERM signal to all of its
children, without logging a thing. If any of the processes still
doesn't quit after a short period, it sends a second
TERM, logs the PID of the process, and marks the event as a warning.
Finally, if the process still hasn't terminated, it
sends the KILL signal, which unconditionaly terminates the process,
aborting any operation in progress in the child. This event is logged
as an error.</p>

<p>If the mod_perl scripts do not contain any <tt class="literal">END</tt>
blocks or <tt class="literal">DESTROY</tt> methods that need to be run
during shutdown, or if the ones they have are nonessential, this step
can be avoided by setting the <tt class="literal">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</tt>
environment variable to <tt class="literal">-1</tt>. (The
<tt class="literal">-1</tt> value for
<tt class="literal">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</tt> is special to mod_perl.) For
example, add this setting to the <em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em>
file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PerlSetEnv PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL -1</pre></blockquote>

<p>What constitutes a significant cleanup? Any change of state outside
the current process that cannot be handled by the operating system
itself. Committing database transactions and removing the lock on a
resource are significant operations, but closing an ordinary file is
not. For example, if DBI is used for persistent database connections,
Perl's destructors should <em class="emphasis">not</em>
be switched off.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">5.3.3. Finding the Right Apache PID</h3>

<p>In order
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4048" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4049" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4050" />to send a signal to a
process, its PID must be known. But in the case of Apache, there are
many <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> processes running. Which one should
be used? The parent process is the one that must be signaled, so it
is the parent's PID that must be identified.</p>

<p>The easiest way to find the Apache parent PID is to read the
<em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4051" /> file. To find this file, look in the
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> file. Open
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> and look for the
<tt class="literal">PidFile</tt> directive. Here is the line from our
<em class="emphasis">httpd.conf</em> file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">PidFile /home/httpd/httpd_perl/logs/httpd.pid</pre></blockquote>

<p>When Apache starts up, it writes its own process ID in
<em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em> in a human-readable format. When the
server is stopped, <em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em> should be deleted,
but if Apache is killed abnormally, <em class="emphasis">httpd.pid</em>
may still exist even if the process is not running any more.</p>

<p>Of course, the PID of the running Apache can also be found using the
<em class="emphasis">ps(1)</em> and <em class="emphasis">grep(1)</em> utilities
(as shown previously). Assuming that the binary is called
<em class="emphasis">httpd_perl</em>, the command would be:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% ps auxc | grep httpd_perl</pre></blockquote>

<p>or, on System V:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% ps -ef | grep httpd_perl</pre></blockquote>

<p>This will produce a list of all the <em class="emphasis">httpd_perl</em>
(parent and child) processes. If the server was started by the
<em class="emphasis">root</em> user account, it will be easy to locate,
since it will belong to <em class="emphasis">root</em>. Here is an example
of the sort of output produced by one of the <em class="emphasis">ps</em>
command lines given above:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">root   17309 0.9 2.7 8344 7096 ?  S 18:22 0:00 httpd_perl
nobody 17310 0.1 2.7 8440 7164 ?  S 18:22 0:00 httpd_perl
nobody 17311 0.0 2.7 8440 7164 ?  S 18:22 0:00 httpd_perl
nobody 17312 0.0 2.7 8440 7164 ?  S 18:22 0:00 httpd_perl</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example, it can be seen that all the child processes are
running as user <em class="emphasis">nobody</em> whereas the parent
process runs as user <em class="emphasis">root</em>. There is only one
<em class="emphasis">root</em> process, and this must be the parent
process. Any <em class="emphasis">kill</em> signals should be sent to this
parent process.</p>

<p>If the server is started under some other user account (e.g., when
the user does not have <em class="emphasis">root</em> access), the
processes will belong to that user. The only truly foolproof way to
identify the parent process is to look for the process whose parent
process ID (PPID) is 1 (use <em class="emphasis">ps</em> to find out the
PPID of the process).</p>

<p>If you have the GNU tools installed on your system, there is a nifty
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4052" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4053" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4054" />utility
that makes it even easier to discover the parent process. The tool is
called <em class="emphasis">pstree</em><a name="pmodperl-CHP-5-ITERM-4055" />, and it is very simple to use. It lists
all the processes showing the <em class="emphasis">family</em> hierarchy,
so if we <em class="emphasis">grep</em> the output for the wanted
process's family, we can see the parent process
right away. Running this utility and <em class="emphasis">grep</em>ing for
<em class="emphasis">httpd_perl</em>, we get:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% pstree -p | grep httpd_perl
  |-httpd_perl(17309)-+-httpd_perl(17310)
  |                   |-httpd_perl(17311)
  |                   |-httpd_perl(17312)</pre></blockquote>

<p>And this one is even simpler:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">panic% pstree -p | grep 'httpd_perl.*httpd_perl'
  |-httpd_perl(17309)-+-httpd_perl(17310)</pre></blockquote>

<p>In both cases, we can see that the parent process has the PID 17309.</p>

<p><em class="emphasis">ps</em>'s <em class="emphasis">f</em>
option, available on many Unix platforms, produces a tree-like report
of the processes as well. For example, you can run <em class="emphasis">ps
axfwwww</em> to get a tree of all processes.</p>
