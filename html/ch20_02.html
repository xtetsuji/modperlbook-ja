<h2 class="sect1">20.2. Improving Performance</h2>

<p>Let's now talk about various techniques that allow
you to boost the speed of applications that work with relational
databases. A whole book could be devoted to this topic, so here we
will concentrate on the techniques that apply specifically to
mod_perl servers.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.1" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.1. Preopening DBI Connections</h3>

<p>If you are using <tt class="literal">Apache::DBI</tt> and
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5424" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5425" />you
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5426" />want to make sure that a database
connection will already be open when your code is first executed
within each child process after a server restart, you should use
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5427" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5428" />the <tt class="literal">connect_on_init( )</tt>
method in the startup file to preopen every connection that you are
going to use. For example:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Apache::DBI-&gt;connect_on_init(
    "DBI:mysql:test:localhost", "my_username", "my_passwd",
    {
     PrintError =&gt; 1, # warn( ) on errors
     RaiseError =&gt; 0, # don't die on error
     AutoCommit =&gt; 1, # commit executes immediately
    }
);</pre></blockquote>

<p>For this method to work, you need to make sure that you have built
mod_perl with <tt class="literal">PERL_CHILD_INIT=1</tt> or
<tt class="literal">EVERYTHING=1</tt>.</p>

<p>Be warned, though, that if you call <tt class="literal">connect_on_init(
)</tt> and your database is down, Apache children will be
delayed at server startup, trying to connect. They
won't begin serving requests until either they are
connected or the connection attempt fails. Depending on your
<tt class="literal">DBD</tt> driver, this can take several minutes!</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.2" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.2. Improving Speed by Skipping ping( )</h3>

<p>If you use <tt class="literal">Apache::DBI</tt> and want to
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5429" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5430" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5431" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5432" />save a little bit of time, you can change
how often the <tt class="literal">ping( )</tt> method is called. The
following setting in a startup file:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">Apache::DBI-&gt;setPingTimeOut($data_source, $timeout)</pre></blockquote>

<p>will change this behavior. If the value of
<tt class="literal">$timeout</tt> is <tt class="literal">0</tt>,
<tt class="literal">Apache:DBI</tt> will validate the database connection
using the <tt class="literal">ping( )</tt> method for every database
access. This is the default. Setting <tt class="literal">$timeout</tt> to a
negative value will deactivate the validation of the database handle.
This can be used for drivers that do not implement the <tt class="literal">ping(
)</tt> method (but it's generally a bad idea,
because you don't know if your database handle
really works). Setting <tt class="literal">$timeout</tt> to a positive
value will <em class="emphasis">ping</em> the database on access only if
the previous access was more than <tt class="literal">$timeout</tt>seconds
earlier.</p>

<p><tt class="literal">$data_source</tt> is the same as in the
<tt class="literal">connect( )</tt> method (e.g.,
<tt class="literal">DBI:mysql:..</tt>.).</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.3" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.3. Efficient Record-Retrieval Techniques</h3>

<p>When working with a relational
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5433" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5434" />database,
you'll often encounter the need to read the
retrieved set of records into your program, then format and print
them to the browser.</p>

<p>Assuming that you're already connected to the
database, let's consider the following code
prototype:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $query = "SELECT id,fname,lname FROM test WHERE id &lt; 10";
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
$sth-&gt;execute;

my @results = ( );
while (my @row_ary  = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_array) {
    push @results, [ transform(@row_ary) ];
}
# print the output using the the data returned from the DB</pre></blockquote>

<p>In this example, the <em class="emphasis">httpd</em> process will grow by
the size of the variables that have been allocated for the records
that matched the query. Remember that to get the total amount of
extra memory required by this technique, this growth should be
multiplied by the number of child processes that your server
runs&#8212;which is probably not a constant.</p>

<p>A better approach is not to accumulate the records, but rather to
print them as they are fetched from the DB. You can use the methods
<tt class="literal">$sth-&gt;bind_columns( )</tt> and
<tt class="literal">$sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref( )</tt> (aliased to
<tt class="literal">$sth-&gt;fetch( )</tt>) to fetch the data in the
fastest possible way. <a href="ch20_02.html#pmodperl-CHP-20-EX-1">Example 20-1</a> prints an HTML
table with matched data. Now the only additional memory consumed is
for an <tt class="literal">@cols</tt> array to hold temporary row values.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-EX-1" /><div class="example">
<h4 class="objtitle">Example 20-1. bind_cols.pl</h4>
<blockquote><pre class="code">my $query = "SELECT id,fname,lname FROM test WHERE id &lt; 10";
my @fields = qw(id fname lname);

# create a list of cols values
my @cols = ( );
@cols[0..$#fields] = ( );
$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
$sth-&gt;execute;

# Bind perl variables to columns.
$sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \(@cols));
print "&lt;table&gt;";
print '&lt;tr bgcolor="grey"&gt;', 
    map("&lt;th&gt;$_&lt;/th&gt;", @fields), "&lt;/tr&gt;";
while ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
    print "&lt;tr&gt;", 
        map("&lt;td&gt;$_&lt;/td&gt;", @cols), "&lt;/tr&gt;";
}
print "&lt;/table&gt;";</pre></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Note that this approach doesn't tell you how many
records have been matched. The workaround is to run an identical
query before the code above, using <tt class="literal">SELECT</tt>
<tt class="literal">count(*)..</tt>. instead of <tt class="literal">SELECT *
..</tt>. to get the number of matched records:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $query = "SELECT count(*) FROM test WHERE id &lt; 10";</pre></blockquote>

<p>This should be much faster, since you can remove any <tt class="literal">SORT
BY</tt> and similar attributes.</p>

<p>You might think that the <tt class="literal">DBI</tt> method
<tt class="literal">$sth-&gt;rows</tt> will tell you how many records will
be returned, but unfortunately it will not. You can rely on a row
count only after a <tt class="literal">do</tt> (for some specific
operations, such as update and delete), after a non-select
<tt class="literal">execute</tt>, or after fetching all the rows of a
<tt class="literal">select</tt>statement.</p>

<p>For <tt class="literal">select</tt>statements, it is generally not
possible to know how many rows will be returned except by fetching
them all. Some <tt class="literal">DBD</tt> drivers will return the number
of rows the application has fetched so far, but others may return
<tt class="literal">-1</tt> until all rows have been fetched. Thus, use of
the <tt class="literal">rows</tt> method with <tt class="literal">select</tt>
statements is not recommended.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.4" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.4. mysql_use_result Versus mysql_store_result Attributes</h3>

<p>Many mod_perl developers
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5435" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5436" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5437" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5438" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5439" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5440" />use MySQL as their
preferred relational database server because of its speed. Depending
on the situation, it may be possible to change the way in which the
<tt class="literal">DBD::mysql</tt> driver delivers data. The two
attributes <tt class="literal">mysql_use_result</tt> and
<tt class="literal">mysql_store_result</tt> influence the speed and size of
the processes.</p>

<p>You can tell the <tt class="literal">DBD::mysql</tt> driver to change the
default behavior before you start to fetch the results:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($query);
$sth-&gt;{"mysql_use_result"} = 1;</pre></blockquote>

<p>This forces the driver to use <tt class="literal">mysql_use_result</tt>
rather than <tt class="literal">mysql_store_result</tt>. The former is
faster and uses less memory, but it tends to block other processes,
which is why <tt class="literal">mysql_store_result</tt> is the default.</p>

<p>Think about it in client/server terms. When you ask the server to
spoon-feed you the data as you use it, the server process must buffer
the data, tie up that thread, and possibly keep database locks open
for a long time. So if you read a row of data and ponder it for a
while, the tables you have locked are still locked, and the server is
busy talking to you every so often. That is the situation with
<tt class="literal">mysql_use_result</tt>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you just suck down the whole data set to the
client, then the server is free to serve other requests. This
improves parallelism, since rather than blocking each other by doing
frequent I/O, the server and client are working at the same time.
That is the situation with <tt class="literal">mysql_store_result</tt>.</p>

<p>As the MySQL manual suggests, you should not use
<tt class="literal">mysql_use_result</tt> if you are doing a lot of
processing for each row on the client side. This can tie up the
server and prevent other threads from updating the tables.</p>

<p>If you are using some other <tt class="literal">DBD</tt> driver, check its
documentation to see if it provides the flexibility of
<tt class="literal">DBD::mysql</tt> in this regard.</p>

<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.5" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.5. Running Two or More Relational Databases</h3>

<p>Sometimes you end up running
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5441" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5442" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5443" />many databases on
the same machine. These might have very different needs. For example,
one may handle user sessions (updated frequently but with tiny
amounts of data), and another may contain large sets of data that are
hardly ever updated. You might be able to improve performance by
running two differently tuned database servers on one machine. The
frequently updated database can gain a lot from fast disk access,
whereas the database with mostly static data could benefit from lots
of caching.</p>

</div>
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-SECT-2.6" /><div class="sect2">
<h3 class="sect2">20.2.6. Caching prepare( ) Statements</h3>

<p>You can also benefit from
<a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5444" /><a name="pmodperl-CHP-20-ITERM-5445" />persistent
connections by replacing <tt class="literal">prepare( )</tt> with
<tt class="literal">prepare_cached( )</tt>. That way you will always be
sure that you have a good statement handle and you will get some
caching benefit. The downside is that you are going to pay for
<tt class="literal">DBI</tt> to parse your SQL and do a cache lookup every
time you call <tt class="literal">prepare_cached( )</tt>. This will give a
big performance boost to database servers that execute
<tt class="literal">prepare( )</tt> quite slowly (e.g., Oracle), but it
might add an unnecessary overhead with servers such as MySQL that do
this operation very quickly.</p>

<p>Be warned that some databases (e.g., PostgreSQL and Sybase)
don't support caches of prepared plans. With Sybase
you could open multiple connections to achieve the same result, but
this is at the risk of getting deadlocks, depending on what you are
trying to do!</p>

<p>Another pitfall to watch out for lies in the fact that
<tt class="literal">prepare_cached( )</tt> actually gives you a reference
to the <em class="emphasis">same</em> cached statement handle, not just a
similar copy. So you can't do this:</p>

<blockquote><pre class="code">my $sth1 = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached('SELECT name FROM table WHERE id=?');
my $sth2 = $dbh-&gt;prepare_cached('SELECT name FROM table WHERE id=?');</pre></blockquote>

<p>because <tt class="literal">$sth1</tt> and <tt class="literal">$sth2</tt> are now
the same object! If you try to use them independently, your code will
fail.</p>

<p>Make sure to read the <tt class="literal">DBI</tt> manpage for the complete
documentation of this method and the latest updates.</p>
